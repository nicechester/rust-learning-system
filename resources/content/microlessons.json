You\u2019ll need\nan internet connection for the download.\n\n> Note: If you prefer not to use `rustup` for some reason, please see the\n> [Other Rust Installation Methods page][otherinstall] for more options.\n\nThe following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.\nRust\u2019s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that\ncompile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might\ndiffer slightly between versions because Rust often improves error messages and\nwarnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install using\nthese steps should work as expected with the content of this book.\n\n> ### Command Line Notation\n>\n> In this chapter and throughout the book, we\u2019ll show some commands used in the\n> terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with `$`. You\n> don\u2019t need to type the `$` character; it\u2019s the command line prompt shown to\n> indicate the start of each command. Lines that don\u2019t start with `$` typically\n> show the output of the previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific\n> examples will use `>` rather than `$`.",

If you get\nlinker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a\nlinker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on\nC code and will need a C compiler.\n\nOn macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:\n\n```console\n$ xcode-select --install\n```\n\nLinux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their\ndistribution\u2019s documentation.

Here\u2019s the first piece of\nthe puzzle:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n\n}\n```\n\nThese lines define a function named `main`. The `main` function is special: It\nis always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the\nfirst line declares a function named `main` that has no parameters and returns\nnothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses (`()`).\n\nThe function body is wrapped in `{}`. Rust requires curly brackets around all\nfunction bodies. It\u2019s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same\nline as the function declaration, adding one space in between.\n\n> Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can\n> use an automatic formatter tool called `rustfmt` to format your code in a\n> particular style (more on `rustfmt` in\n> [Appendix D][devtools]<!-- ignore -->). The Rust team has included this tool\n> with the standard Rust distribution, as `rustc` is, so it should already be\n> installed on your computer!\n\nThe body of the `main` function holds the following code:\n\n```rust\nprintln!(\"Hello, world!\");\n```\n\nThis line does all the work in this little program: It prints text to the\nscreen. There are three important details to notice here.\n\nFirst, `println!` calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it\nwould be entered as `println` (without the `!`). Rust macros are a way to write\ncode that generates code to extend Rust syntax, and we\u2019ll discuss them in more\ndetail in [Chapter 20][ch20-macros]<!-- ignore -->. For now, you just need to\nknow that using a `!` means that you\u2019re calling a macro instead of a normal\nfunction and that macros don\u2019t always follow the same rules as functions.\n\nSecond, you see the `\"Hello, world!\"` string. We pass this string as an argument\nto `println!`, and the string is printed to the screen.\n\nThird, we end the line with a semicolon (`;`), which indicates that this\nexpression is over, and the next one is ready to begin.

    "content": "You\u2019ve just run a newly created program, so let\u2019s examine each step in the\nprocess.\n\nBefore running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by\nentering the `rustc` command and passing it the name of your source file, like\nthis:\n\n```console\n$ rustc main.rs\n```\n\nIf you have a C or C++ background, you\u2019ll notice that this is similar to `gcc`\nor `clang`. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.\n\nOn Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by\nentering the `ls` command in your shell:\n\n```console\n$ ls\nmain  main.rs\n```\n\nOn Linux and macOS, you\u2019ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you\u2019ll\nsee the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD on Windows, you\nwould enter the following:\n\n```cmd\n> dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%\nmain.exe\nmain.pdb\nmain.rs\n```\n\nThis shows the source code file with the _.rs_ extension, the executable file\n(_main.exe_ on Windows, but _main_ on all other platforms), and, when using\nWindows, a file containing debugging information with the _.pdb_ extension.\nFrom here, you run the _main_ or _main.exe_ file, like this:\n\n```console\n$ ./main # or .\\main on Windows\n```\n\nIf your _main.rs_ is your \u201cHello, world!\u201d program, this line prints `Hello,\nworld!` to your terminal.\n\nIf you\u2019re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or\nJavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as\nseparate steps. Rust is an _ahead-of-time compiled_ language, meaning you can\ncompile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it\neven without having Rust installed. If you give someone a _.rb_, _.py_, or\n_.js_ file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation\ninstalled (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to\ncompile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.\n\nJust compiling with `rustc` is fine for simple programs, but as your project\ngrows, you\u2019ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your\ncode. Next, we\u2019ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write\nreal-world Rust programs.\n\n[troubleshooting]: ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting\n[devtools]: appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html\n[ch20-macros]: ch20-05-macros.html",

Then, on any operating system,\nrun the following:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new hello_cargo\n$ cd hello_cargo\n```\n\nThe first command creates a new directory and project called _hello_cargo_.\nWe\u2019ve named our project _hello_cargo_, and Cargo creates its files in a\ndirectory of the same name.\n\nGo into the _hello_cargo_ directory and list the files. You\u2019ll see that Cargo\nhas generated two files and one directory for us: a _Cargo.toml_ file and a\n_src_ directory with a _main.rs_ file inside.\n\nIt has also initialized a new Git repository along with a _.gitignore_ file.\nGit files won\u2019t be generated if you run `cargo new` within an existing Git\nrepository; you can override this behavior by using `cargo new --vcs=git`.\n\n> Note: Git is a common version control system.

As we add more information to\nthis file, we\u2019ll add other sections.\n\nThe next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile\nyour program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We\u2019ll talk\nabout the `edition` key in [Appendix E][appendix-e]<!-- ignore -->.\n\nThe last line, `[dependencies]`, is the start of a section for you to list any\nof your project\u2019s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as\n_crates_. We won\u2019t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the\nfirst project in Chapter 2, so we\u2019ll use this dependencies section then.\n\nNow open _src/main.rs_ and take a look:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n```\n\nCargo has generated a \u201cHello, world!\u201d program for you, just like the one we\nwrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the\nproject Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the _src_ directory,\nand we have a _Cargo.toml_ configuration file in the top directory.\n\nCargo expects your source files to live inside the _src_ directory. The\ntop-level project directory is just for README files, license information,\nconfiguration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo\nhelps you organize your projects. There\u2019s a place for everything, and\neverything is in its place.\n\nIf you started a project that doesn\u2019t use Cargo, as we did with the \u201cHello,\nworld!\u201d project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the\nproject code into the _src_ directory and create an appropriate _Cargo.toml_\nfile. One easy way to get that _Cargo.toml_ file is to run `cargo init`, which\nwill create it for you automatically.",

Running `cargo\nbuild` for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top\nlevel: _Cargo.lock_. This file keeps track of the exact versions of\ndependencies in your project. This project doesn\u2019t have dependencies, so the\nfile is a bit sparse. You won\u2019t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo\nmanages its contents for you.\n\nWe just built a project with `cargo build` and ran it with\n`./target/debug/hello_cargo`, but we can also use `cargo run` to compile the\ncode and then run the resultant executable all in one command:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\nHello, world!\n```\n\nUsing `cargo run` is more convenient than having to remember to run `cargo\nbuild` and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use `cargo\nrun`.\n\nNotice that this time we didn\u2019t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling\n`hello_cargo`. Cargo figured out that the files hadn\u2019t changed, so it didn\u2019t\nrebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo\nwould have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this\noutput:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\nHello, world!\n```\n\nCargo also provides a command called `cargo check`. This command quickly checks\nyour code to make sure it compiles but doesn\u2019t produce an executable:\n\n```console\n$ cargo check\n   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs\n```\n\nWhy would you not want an executable? Often, `cargo check` is much faster than\n`cargo build` because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you\u2019re\ncontinually checking your work while writing the code, using `cargo check` will\nspeed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As\nsuch, many Rustaceans run `cargo check` periodically as they write their\nprogram to make sure it compiles. Then, they run `cargo build` when they\u2019re\nready to use the executable.\n\nLet\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned so far about Cargo:\n\n- We can create a project using `cargo new`.\n- We can build a project using `cargo build`.\n- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.\n- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using\n  `cargo check`.\n- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code,\n  Cargo stores it in the _target/debug_ directory.\n\nAn additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no\nmatter which operating system you\u2019re working on. So, at this point, we\u2019ll no\nlonger provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.",

    "content": "# Programming a Guessing Game\n\nLet\u2019s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This\nchapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use\nthem in a real program. You\u2019ll learn about `let`, `match`, methods, associated\nfunctions, external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we\u2019ll explore\nthese ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you\u2019ll just practice the\nfundamentals.\n\nWe\u2019ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here\u2019s\nhow it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It\nwill then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the\nprogram will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is\ncorrect, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.\n\n## Setting Up a New Project\n\nTo set up a new project, go to the _projects_ directory that you created in\nChapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new guessing_game\n$ cd guessing_game\n```\n\nThe first command, `cargo new`, takes the name of the project (`guessing_game`)\nas the first argument. The second command changes to the new project\u2019s\ndirectory.\n\nLook at the generated _Cargo.toml_ file:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial\nrm -rf no-listing-01-cargo-new\ncargo new no-listing-01-cargo-new --name guessing_game\ncd no-listing-01-cargo-new\ncargo run > output.txt 2>&1\ncd ../../..\n-->\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-01-cargo-new/Cargo.toml}}\n```\n\nAs you saw in Chapter 1, `cargo new` generates a \u201cHello, world!\u201d program for\nyou. Check out the _src/main.rs_ file:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-01-cargo-new/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nNow let\u2019s compile this \u201cHello, world!\u201d program and run it in the same step\nusing the `cargo run` command:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-01-cargo-new/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe `run` command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,\nas we\u2019ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before moving on to\nthe next one.\n\nReopen the _src/main.rs_ file. You\u2019ll be writing all the code in this file.\n\n## Processing a Guess\n\nThe first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process\nthat input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we\u2019ll\nallow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into\n_src/main.rs_.\n\n<Listing number=\"2-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Code that gets a guess from the user and prints it\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code contains a lot of information, so let\u2019s go over it line by line. To\nobtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the\n`io` input/output library into scope. The `io` library comes from the standard\nlibrary, known as `std`:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:io}}\n```\n\nBy default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it\nbrings into the scope of every program. This set is called the _prelude_, and\nyou can see everything in it [in the standard library documentation][prelude].\n\nIf a type you want to use isn\u2019t in the prelude, you have to bring that type\ninto scope explicitly with a `use` statement. Using the `std::io` library\nprovides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept\nuser input.\n\nAs you saw in Chapter 1, the `main` function is the entry point into the\nprogram:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:main}}\n```\n\nThe `fn` syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, `()`, indicate there\nare no parameters; and the curly bracket, `{`, starts the body of the function.\n\nAs you also learned in Chapter 1, `println!` is a macro that prints a string to\nthe screen:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:print}}\n```\n\nThis code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input\nfrom the user.",

There\u2019s a lot going on in this little\nline. We use the `let` statement to create the variable. Here\u2019s another example:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet apples = 5;\n```\n\nThis line creates a new variable named `apples` and binds it to the value `5`.\nIn Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable\na value, the value won\u2019t change. We\u2019ll be discussing this concept in detail in\nthe [\u201cVariables and Mutability\u201d][variables-and-mutability]<!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the\nvariable name:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet apples = 5; // immutable\nlet mut bananas = 5; // mutable\n```\n\n> Note: The `//` syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the\n> line. Rust ignores everything in comments. We\u2019ll discuss comments in more\n> detail in [Chapter 3][comments]<!-- ignore -->.\n\nReturning to the guessing game program, you now know that `let mut guess` will\nintroduce a mutable variable named `guess`. The equal sign (`=`) tells Rust we\nwant to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is\nthe value that `guess` is bound to, which is the result of calling\n`String::new`, a function that returns a new instance of a `String`.\n[`String`][string]<!-- ignore --> is a string type provided by the standard\nlibrary that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.\n\nThe `::` syntax in the `::new` line indicates that `new` is an associated\nfunction of the `String` type. An _associated function_ is a function that\u2019s\nimplemented on a type, in this case `String`. This `new` function creates a\nnew, empty string. You\u2019ll find a `new` function on many types because it\u2019s a\ncommon name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.\n\nIn full, the `let mut guess = String::new();` line has created a mutable\nvariable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a `String`.

The `stdin` function returns an instance of\n[`std::io::Stdin`][iostdin]<!-- ignore -->, which is a type that represents a\nhandle to the standard input for your terminal.\n\nNext, the line `.read_line(&mut guess)` calls the [`read_line`][read_line]<!--\nignore --> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.\nWe\u2019re also passing `&mut guess` as the argument to `read_line` to tell it what\nstring to store the user input in. The full job of `read_line` is to take\nwhatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string\n(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an\nargument. The string argument needs to be mutable so that the method can change\nthe string\u2019s content.\n\nThe `&` indicates that this argument is a _reference_, which gives you a way to\nlet multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to\ncopy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,\nand one of Rust\u2019s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use\nreferences. You don\u2019t need to know a lot of those details to finish this\nprogram. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are\nimmutable by default. Hence, you need to write `&mut guess` rather than\n`&guess` to make it mutable.

Now let\u2019s\ndiscuss what this line does.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, `read_line` puts whatever the user enters into the string\nwe pass to it, but it also returns a `Result` value. [`Result`][result]<!--\nignore --> is an [_enumeration_][enums]<!-- ignore -->, often called an _enum_,\nwhich is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each\npossible state a _variant_.\n\n[Chapter 6][enums]<!-- ignore --> will cover enums in more detail. The purpose\nof these `Result` types is to encode error-handling information.\n\n`Result`\u2019s variants are `Ok` and `Err`. The `Ok` variant indicates the\noperation was successful, and it contains the successfully generated value.\nThe `Err` variant means the operation failed, and it contains information\nabout how or why the operation failed.\n\nValues of the `Result` type, like values of any type, have methods defined on\nthem. An instance of `Result` has an [`expect` method][expect]<!-- ignore -->\nthat you can call. If this instance of `Result` is an `Err` value, `expect`\nwill cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an\nargument to `expect`. If the `read_line` method returns an `Err`, it would\nlikely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.\nIf this instance of `Result` is an `Ok` value, `expect` will take the return\nvalue that `Ok` is holding and return just that value to you so that you can\nuse it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user\u2019s input.\n\nIf you don\u2019t call `expect`, the program will compile, but you\u2019ll get a warning:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-02-without-expect/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust warns that you haven\u2019t used the `Result` value returned from `read_line`,\nindicating that the program hasn\u2019t handled a possible error.\n\nThe right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code,\nbut in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we\ncan use `expect`.

The `rand` crate\nis a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other\nprograms and can\u2019t be executed on its own.\n\nCargo\u2019s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we\ncan write code that uses `rand`, we need to modify the _Cargo.toml_ file to\ninclude the `rand` crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the\nfollowing line to the bottom, beneath the `[dependencies]` section header that\nCargo created for you. Be sure to specify `rand` exactly as we have here, with\nthis version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:\n\n<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of\n`rand` used in these files so they all match:\n* ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.md\n* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md\n-->\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/Cargo.toml:8:}}\n```\n\nIn the _Cargo.toml_ file, everything that follows a header is part of that\nsection that continues until another section starts. In `[dependencies]`, you\ntell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of\nthose crates you require. In this case, we specify the `rand` crate with the\nsemantic version specifier `0.8.5`. Cargo understands [Semantic\nVersioning][semver]<!-- ignore --> (sometimes called _SemVer_), which is a\nstandard for writing version numbers. The specifier `0.8.5` is actually\nshorthand for `^0.8.5`, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but\nbelow 0.9.0.\n\nCargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version\n0.8.5, and this specification ensures that you\u2019ll get the latest patch release\nthat will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or\ngreater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples\nuse.\n\nNow, without changing any of the code, let\u2019s build the project, as shown in\nListing 2-2.\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/\nrm Cargo.lock\ncargo clean\ncargo build -->\n\n<Listing number=\"2-2\" caption=\"The output from running `cargo build` after adding the `rand` crate as a dependency\">\n\n```console\n$ cargo build\n  Updating crates.io index\n   Locking 15 packages to latest Rust 1.85.0 compatible versions\n    Adding rand v0.8.5 (available: v0.9.0)\n Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.93\n Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.17\n Compiling libc v0.2.170\n Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0\n Compiling byteorder v1.5.0\n Compiling getrandom v0.2.15\n Compiling rand_core v0.6.4\n Compiling quote v1.0.38\n Compiling syn v2.0.98\n Compiling zerocopy-derive v0.7.35\n Compiling zerocopy v0.7.35\n Compiling ppv-lite86 v0.2.20\n Compiling rand_chacha v0.3.1\n Compiling rand v0.8.5\n Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n  Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.48s\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nYou may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the\ncode, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating\nsystem), and the lines may be in a different order.\n\nWhen we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of\neverything that dependency needs from the _registry_, which is a copy of data\nfrom [Crates.io][cratesio]. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem\npost their open source Rust projects for others to use.\n\nAfter updating the registry, Cargo checks the `[dependencies]` section and\ndownloads any crates listed that aren\u2019t already downloaded. In this case,\nalthough we only listed `rand` as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates\nthat `rand` depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles\nthem and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.\n\nIf you immediately run `cargo build` again without making any changes, you\nwon\u2019t get any output aside from the `Finished` line. Cargo knows it has already\ndownloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven\u2019t changed anything\nabout them in your _Cargo.toml_ file. Cargo also knows that you haven\u2019t changed\nanything about your code, so it doesn\u2019t recompile that either. With nothing to\ndo, it simply exits.\n\nIf you open the _src/main.rs_ file, make a trivial change, and then save it and\nbuild again, you\u2019ll only see two lines of output:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/\ntouch src/main.rs\ncargo build -->\n\n```console\n$ cargo build\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s\n```\n\nThese lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the\n_src/main.rs_ file. Your dependencies haven\u2019t changed, so Cargo knows it can\nreuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n<a id=\"ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargo-lock-file\"></a>\n\n#### Ensuring Reproducible Builds\n\nCargo has a mechanism that ensures that you can rebuild the same artifact every\ntime you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of\nthe dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say\nthat next week version 0.8.6 of the `rand` crate comes out, and that version\ncontains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will\nbreak your code. To handle this, Rust creates the _Cargo.lock_ file the first\ntime you run `cargo build`, so we now have this in the _guessing_game_\ndirectory.\n\nWhen you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions\nof the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the\n_Cargo.lock_ file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see\nthat the _Cargo.lock_ file exists and will use the versions specified there\nrather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you\nhave a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will\nremain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the _Cargo.lock_ file.\nBecause the _Cargo.lock_ file is important for reproducible builds, it\u2019s often\nchecked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.\n\n#### Updating a Crate to Get a New Version\n\nWhen you _do_ want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command `update`,\nwhich will ignore the _Cargo.lock_ file and figure out all the latest versions\nthat fit your specifications in _Cargo.toml_. Cargo will then write those\nversions to the _Cargo.lock_ file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look\nfor versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the `rand` crate has\nreleased the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.999.0, you would see the following if\nyou ran `cargo update`:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/\ncargo update\nassuming there is a new 0.8.x version of rand; otherwise use another update\nas a guide to creating the hypothetical output shown here -->\n\n```console\n$ cargo update\n    Updating crates.io index\n     Locking 1 package to latest Rust 1.85.0 compatible version\n    Updating rand v0.8.5 -> v0.8.6 (available: v0.999.0)\n```\n\nCargo ignores the 0.999.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a\nchange in your _Cargo.lock_ file noting that the version of the `rand` crate\nyou are now using is 0.8.6. To use `rand` version 0.999.0 or any version in the\n0.999._x_ series, you\u2019d have to update the _Cargo.toml_ file to look like this\ninstead (don\u2019t actually make this change because the following examples assume\nyou\u2019re using `rand` 0.8):\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.999.0\"\n```\n\nThe next time you run `cargo build`, Cargo will update the registry of crates\navailable and reevaluate your `rand` requirements according to the new version\nyou have specified.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to say about [Cargo][doccargo]<!-- ignore --> and [its\necosystem][doccratesio]<!-- ignore -->, which we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 14, but\nfor now, that\u2019s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse\nlibraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled\nfrom a number of packages.",

The next step is to\nupdate _src/main.rs_, as shown in Listing 2-3.\n\n<Listing number=\"2-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Adding code to generate a random number\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-03/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we add the line `use rand::Rng;`. The `Rng` trait defines methods that\nrandom number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to\nuse those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.\n\nNext, we\u2019re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the\n`rand::thread_rng` function that gives us the particular random number\ngenerator we\u2019re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of\nexecution and is seeded by the operating system. Then, we call the `gen_range`\nmethod on the random number generator. This method is defined by the `Rng`\ntrait that we brought into scope with the `use rand::Rng;` statement. The\n`gen_range` method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a\nrandom number in the range. The kind of range expression we\u2019re using here takes\nthe form `start..=end` and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we\nneed to specify `1..=100` to request a number between 1 and 100.\n\n> Note: You won\u2019t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions\n> to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for\n> using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the `cargo doc\n> --open` command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies\n> locally and open it in your browser. If you\u2019re interested in other\n> functionality in the `rand` crate, for example, run `cargo doc --open` and\n> click `rand` in the sidebar on the left.\n\nThe second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we\u2019re\ndeveloping the program to be able to test it, but we\u2019ll delete it from the\nfinal version. It\u2019s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon\nas it starts!\n\nTry running the program a few times:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-03/\ncargo run\n4\ncargo run\n5\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 7\nPlease input your guess.\n4\nYou guessed: 4\n\n$ cargo run\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 83\nPlease input your guess.\n5\nYou guessed: 5\n```\n\nYou should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers between\n1 and 100. Great job!\n\n## Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number\n\nNow that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. That step\nis shown in Listing 2-4. Note that this code won\u2019t compile just yet, as we will\nexplain.\n\n<Listing number=\"2-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Handling the possible return values of comparing two numbers\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we add another `use` statement, bringing a type called\n`std::cmp::Ordering` into scope from the standard library. The `Ordering` type\nis another enum and has the variants `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`. These are\nthe three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.\n\nThen, we add five new lines at the bottom that use the `Ordering` type. The\n`cmp` method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be\ncompared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: Here, it\u2019s\ncomparing `guess` to `secret_number`. Then, it returns a variant of the\n`Ordering` enum we brought into scope with the `use` statement. We use a\n[`match`][match]<!-- ignore --> expression to decide what to do next based on\nwhich variant of `Ordering` was returned from the call to `cmp` with the values\nin `guess` and `secret_number`.\n\nA `match` expression is made up of _arms_. An arm consists of a _pattern_ to\nmatch against, and the code that should be run if the value given to `match`\nfits that arm\u2019s pattern. Rust takes the value given to `match` and looks\nthrough each arm\u2019s pattern in turn. Patterns and the `match` construct are\npowerful Rust features: They let you express a variety of situations your code\nmight encounter, and they make sure you handle them all. These features will be\ncovered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 19, respectively.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through an example with the `match` expression we use here. Say that\nthe user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is\n38.\n\nWhen the code compares 50 to 38, the `cmp` method will return\n`Ordering::Greater` because 50 is greater than 38. The `match` expression gets\nthe `Ordering::Greater` value and starts checking each arm\u2019s pattern. It looks\nat the first arm\u2019s pattern, `Ordering::Less`, and sees that the value\n`Ordering::Greater` does not match `Ordering::Less`, so it ignores the code in\nthat arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm\u2019s pattern is\n`Ordering::Greater`, which _does_ match `Ordering::Greater`! The associated\ncode in that arm will execute and print `Too big!` to the screen. The `match`\nexpression ends after the first successful match, so it won\u2019t look at the last\narm in this scenario.\n\nHowever, the code in Listing 2-4 won\u2019t compile yet. Let\u2019s try it:\n\n<!--\nThe error numbers in this output should be that of the code **WITHOUT** the\nanchor or snip comments\n-->\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-04/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe core of the error states that there are _mismatched types_. Rust has a\nstrong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote\n`let mut guess = String::new()`, Rust was able to infer that `guess` should be\na `String` and didn\u2019t make us write the type. The `secret_number`, on the other\nhand, is a number type. A few of Rust\u2019s number types can have a value between 1\nand 100: `i32`, a 32-bit number; `u32`, an unsigned 32-bit number; `i64`, a\n64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to\nan `i32`, which is the type of `secret_number` unless you add type information\nelsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason\nfor the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.\n\nUltimately, we want to convert the `String` the program reads as input into a\nnumber type so that we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do\nso by adding this line to the `main` function body:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-03-convert-string-to-number/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe line is:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(\"Please type a number!\");\n```\n\nWe create a variable named `guess`. But wait, doesn\u2019t the program already have\na variable named `guess`? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the\nprevious value of `guess` with a new one. _Shadowing_ lets us reuse the `guess`\nvariable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as\n`guess_str` and `guess`, for example. We\u2019ll cover this in more detail in\n[Chapter 3][shadowing]<!-- ignore -->, but for now, know that this feature is\noften used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.\n\nWe bind this new variable to the expression `guess.trim().parse()`. The `guess`\nin the expression refers to the original `guess` variable that contained the\ninput as a string. The `trim` method on a `String` instance will eliminate any\nwhitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do before we can convert the\nstring to a `u32`, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press\n<kbd>enter</kbd> to satisfy `read_line` and input their guess, which adds a\nnewline character to the string. For example, if the user types <kbd>5</kbd> and\npresses <kbd>enter</kbd>, `guess` looks like this: `5\\n`. The `\\n` represents\n\u201cnewline.\u201d (On Windows, pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> results in a carriage return\nand a newline, `\\r\\n`.) The `trim` method eliminates `\\n` or `\\r\\n`, resulting\nin just `5`.\n\nThe [`parse` method on strings][parse]<!-- ignore --> converts a string to\nanother type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to\ntell Rust the exact number type we want by using `let guess: u32`. The colon\n(`:`) after `guess` tells Rust we\u2019ll annotate the variable\u2019s type. Rust has a\nfew built-in number types; the `u32` seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.\nIt\u2019s a good default choice for a small positive number. You\u2019ll learn about\nother number types in [Chapter 3][integers]<!-- ignore -->.\n\nAdditionally, the `u32` annotation in this example program and the comparison\nwith `secret_number` means Rust will infer that `secret_number` should be a\n`u32` as well. So, now the comparison will be between two values of the same\ntype!\n\nThe `parse` method will only work on characters that can logically be converted\ninto numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string\ncontained `A\ud83d\udc4d%`, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it\nmight fail, the `parse` method returns a `Result` type, much as the `read_line`\nmethod does (discussed earlier in [\u201cHandling Potential Failure with\n`Result`\u201d](#handling-potential-failure-with-result)<!-- ignore -->). We\u2019ll treat\nthis `Result` the same way by using the `expect` method again. If `parse`\nreturns an `Err` `Result` variant because it couldn\u2019t create a number from the\nstring, the `expect` call will crash the game and print the message we give it.\nIf `parse` can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the\n`Ok` variant of `Result`, and `expect` will return the number that we want from\nthe `Ok` value.\n\nLet\u2019s run the program now:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-03-convert-string-to-number/\ntouch src/main.rs\ncargo run\n  76\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 58\nPlease input your guess.\n  76\nYou guessed: 76\nToo big!\n```\n\nNice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured\nout that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify the\ndifferent behavior with different kinds of input: Guess the number correctly,\nguess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too low.\n\nWe have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.\nLet\u2019s change that by adding a loop!\n\n## Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping\n\nThe `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. We\u2019ll add a loop to give users\nmore chances at guessing the number:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-04-looping/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into\na loop. Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each\nand run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever,\nwhich actually introduces a new problem. It doesn\u2019t seem like the user can quit!\n\nThe user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut\n<kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>. But there\u2019s another way to escape this insatiable\nmonster, as mentioned in the `parse` discussion in [\u201cComparing the Guess to the\nSecret Number\u201d](#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number)<!-- ignore -->: If\nthe user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take\nadvantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-04-looping/\ntouch src/main.rs\ncargo run\n(too small guess)\n(too big guess)\n(correct guess)\nquit\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 59\nPlease input your guess.\n45\nYou guessed: 45\nToo small!\nPlease input your guess.\n60\nYou guessed: 60\nToo big!\nPlease input your guess.\n59\nYou guessed: 59\nYou win!\nPlease input your guess.\nquit\n\nthread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:28:47:\nPlease type a number!: ParseIntError { kind: InvalidDigit }\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n```\n\nTyping `quit` will quit the game, but as you\u2019ll notice, so will entering any\nother non-number input.

We can do that by altering the line where\n`guess` is converted from a `String` to a `u32`, as shown in Listing 2-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"2-5\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for another guess instead of crashing the program\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-05/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe switch from an `expect` call to a `match` expression to move from crashing\non an error to handling the error. Remember that `parse` returns a `Result`\ntype and `Result` is an enum that has the variants `Ok` and `Err`. We\u2019re using\na `match` expression here, as we did with the `Ordering` result of the `cmp`\nmethod.\n\nIf `parse` is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will\nreturn an `Ok` value that contains the resultant number. That `Ok` value will\nmatch the first arm\u2019s pattern, and the `match` expression will just return the\n`num` value that `parse` produced and put inside the `Ok` value. That number\nwill end up right where we want it in the new `guess` variable we\u2019re creating.\n\nIf `parse` is _not_ able to turn the string into a number, it will return an\n`Err` value that contains more information about the error. The `Err` value\ndoes not match the `Ok(num)` pattern in the first `match` arm, but it does\nmatch the `Err(_)` pattern in the second arm. The underscore, `_`, is a\ncatch-all value; in this example, we\u2019re saying we want to match all `Err`\nvalues, no matter what information they have inside them. So, the program will\nexecute the second arm\u2019s code, `continue`, which tells the program to go to the\nnext iteration of the `loop` and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the\nprogram ignores all errors that `parse` might encounter!\n\nNow everything in the program should work as expected. Let\u2019s try it:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-05/\ncargo run\n(too small guess)\n(too big guess)\nfoo\n(correct guess)\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 61\nPlease input your guess.\n10\nYou guessed: 10\nToo small!\nPlease input your guess.\n99\nYou guessed: 99\nToo big!\nPlease input your guess.\nfoo\nPlease input your guess.\n61\nYou guessed: 61\nYou win!\n```\n\nAwesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finish the guessing game. Recall\nthat the program is still printing the secret number. That worked well for\ntesting, but it ruins the game. Let\u2019s delete the `println!` that outputs the\nsecret number.

Congratulations!\n\n## Summary\n\nThis project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:\n`let`, `match`, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next\nfew chapters, you\u2019ll learn about these concepts in more detail.

These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning\nthem early will give you a strong core to start from.\n\n> #### Keywords\n>\n> The Rust language has a set of _keywords_ that are reserved for use by the\n> language only, much as in other languages.

    "content": "## Variables and Mutability\n\nAs mentioned in the [\u201cStoring Values with\nVariables\u201d][storing-values-with-variables]<!-- ignore --> section, by default,\nvariables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write\nyour code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that\nRust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.\nLet\u2019s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why\nsometimes you might want to opt out.\n\nWhen a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can\u2019t change\nthat value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called _variables_ in\nyour _projects_ directory by using `cargo new variables`.\n\nThen, in your new _variables_ directory, open _src/main.rs_ and replace its\ncode with the following code, which won\u2019t compile just yet:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-01-variables-are-immutable/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nSave and run the program using `cargo run`. You should receive an error message\nregarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-01-variables-are-immutable/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.\nCompiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program\nisn\u2019t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do _not_ mean that you\u2019re\nnot a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.\n\nYou received the error message `` cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x` `` because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable `x` variable.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a\nvalue that\u2019s designated as immutable, because this very situation can lead to\nbugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will\nnever change and another part of our code changes that value, it\u2019s possible\nthat the first part of the code won\u2019t do what it was designed to do. The cause\nof this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially\nwhen the second piece of code changes the value only _sometimes_. The Rust\ncompiler guarantees that when you state that a value won\u2019t change, it really\nwon\u2019t change, so you don\u2019t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus\neasier to reason through.\n\nBut mutability can be very useful and can make code more convenient to write.\nAlthough variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by\nadding `mut` in front of the variable name as you did in [Chapter\n2][storing-values-with-variables]<!-- ignore -->. Adding `mut` also conveys\nintent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code\nwill be changing this variable\u2019s value.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s change _src/main.rs_ to the following:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-02-adding-mut/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWhen we run the program now, we get this:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-02-adding-mut/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWe\u2019re allowed to change the value bound to `x` from `5` to `6` when `mut` is\nused. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and\ndepends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Like immutable variables, _constants_ are values that are bound to a name and\nare not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants\nand variables.\n\nFirst, you aren\u2019t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren\u2019t just\nimmutable by default\u2014they\u2019re always immutable. You declare constants using the\n`const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_\nbe annotated. We\u2019ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,\n[\u201cData Types\u201d][data-types]<!-- ignore -->, so don\u2019t worry about the details\nright now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.\n\nConstants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes\nthem useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.\n\nThe last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,\nnot the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a constant declaration:\n\n```rust\nconst THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;\n```\n\nThe constant\u2019s name is `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS`, and its value is set to the\nresult of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number\nof minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this\nprogram). Rust\u2019s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with\nunderscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of\noperations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a\nway that\u2019s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant\nto the value 10,800. See the [Rust Reference\u2019s section on constant\nevaluation][const-eval] for more information on what operations can be used\nwhen declaring constants.\n\nConstants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in\nwhich they were declared. This property makes constants useful for values in\nyour application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know\nabout, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to\nearn, or the speed of light.\n\nNaming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in\nconveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also\nhelps to have only one place in your code that you would need to change if the\nhardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.",

    "title": "Shadowing",
    "content": "As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in [Chapter\n2][comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number]<!-- ignore -->, you can declare a\nnew variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the\nfirst variable is _shadowed_ by the second, which means that the second\nvariable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.\nIn effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the\nvariable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.\nWe can shadow a variable by using the same variable\u2019s name and repeating the\nuse of the `let` keyword as follows:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-03-shadowing/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then, it creates a new variable\n`x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so that\nthe value of `x` is `6`. Then, within an inner scope created with the curly\nbrackets, the third `let` statement also shadows `x` and creates a new\nvariable, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a value of `12`.\nWhen that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and `x` returns to being `6`.\nWhen we run this program, it will output the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-03-shadowing/output.txt}}\n```\n\nShadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we\u2019ll get a\ncompile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without\nusing the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations\non a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have\ncompleted.\n\nThe other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we\u2019re\neffectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can\nchange the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our\nprogram asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by\ninputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-04-shadowing-can-change-types/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe first `spaces` variable is a string type, and the second `spaces` variable\nis a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with\ndifferent names, such as `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; instead, we can reuse\nthe simpler `spaces` name. However, if we try to use `mut` for this, as shown\nhere, we\u2019ll get a compile-time error:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-05-mut-cant-change-types/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe error says we\u2019re not allowed to mutate a variable\u2019s type:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-05-mut-cant-change-types/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNow that we\u2019ve explored how variables work, let\u2019s look at more data types they\ncan have.\n\n[comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number]: ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number\n[data-types]: ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types\n[storing-values-with-variables]: ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables\n[const-eval]: ../reference/const_eval.html",

    "title": "Scalar Types",
    "content": "A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:\nintegers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize\nthese from other programming languages. Let\u2019s jump into how they work in Rust.\n\n#### Integer Types\n\nAn _integer_ is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer\ntype in Chapter 2, the `u32` type. This type declaration indicates that the\nvalue it\u2019s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types\nstart with `i` instead of `u`) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows\nthe built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare\nthe type of an integer value.\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust</span>\n\n| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |\n| ------- | ------- | -------- |\n| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |\n| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |\n| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |\n| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |\n| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |\n| Architecture-dependent | `isize` | `usize`  |\n\nEach variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.\n_Signed_ and _unsigned_ refer to whether it\u2019s possible for the number to be\nnegative\u2014in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it\n(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be\nrepresented without a sign (unsigned). It\u2019s like writing numbers on paper: When\nthe sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,\nwhen it\u2019s safe to assume the number is positive, it\u2019s shown with no sign.\nSigned numbers are stored using [two\u2019s complement][twos-complement]<!-- ignore\n--> representation.\n\nEach signed variant can store numbers from \u2212(2<sup>n \u2212 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n \u2212\n1</sup> \u2212 1 inclusive, where _n_ is the number of bits that variant uses. So, an\n`i8` can store numbers from \u2212(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> \u2212 1, which equals\n\u2212128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 1,\nso a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> \u2212 1, which equals 0 to 255.\n\nAdditionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the\ncomputer your program is running on: 64 bits if you\u2019re on a 64-bit architecture\nand 32 bits if you\u2019re on a 32-bit architecture.\n\nYou can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note\nthat number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,\nsuch as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a\nvisual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will\nhave the same value as if you had specified `1000`.\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust</span>\n\n| Number literals  | Example       |\n| ---------------- | ------------- |\n| Decimal          | `98_222`      |\n| Hex              | `0xff`        |\n| Octal            | `0o77`        |\n| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |\n| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |\n\nSo how do you know which type of integer to use? If you\u2019re unsure, Rust\u2019s\ndefaults are generally good places to start: Integer types default to `i32`.\nThe primary situation in which you\u2019d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing\nsome sort of collection.\n\n> ##### Integer Overflow\n>\n> Let\u2019s say you have a variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and\n> 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as\n> 256, _integer overflow_ will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.\n> When you\u2019re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow\n> that cause your program to _panic_ at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust\n> uses the term _panicking_ when a program exits with an error; we\u2019ll discuss\n> panics in more depth in the [\u201cUnrecoverable Errors with\n> `panic!`\u201d][unrecoverable-errors-with-panic]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter\n> 9.\n>\n> When you\u2019re compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does\n> _not_ include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if\n> overflow occurs, Rust performs _two\u2019s complement wrapping_. In short, values\n> greater than the maximum value the type can hold \u201cwrap around\u201d to the minimum\n> of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes\n> 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won\u2019t panic, but the\n> variable will have a value that probably isn\u2019t what you were expecting it to\n> have. Relying on integer overflow\u2019s wrapping behavior is considered an error.\n>\n> To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families\n> of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:\n>\n> - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.\n> - Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.\n> - Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with\n>   the `overflowing_*` methods.\n> - Saturate at the value\u2019s minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*`\n>   methods.\n\n#### Floating-Point Types\n\nRust also has two primitive types for _floating-point numbers_, which are\nnumbers with decimal points. Rust\u2019s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`,\nwhich are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`\nbecause on modern CPUs, it\u2019s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of\nmore precision. All floating-point types are signed.\n\nHere\u2019s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-06-floating-point/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nFloating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.\n\n#### Numeric Operations\n\nRust supports the basic mathematical operations you\u2019d expect for all the number\ntypes: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer\ndivision truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows\nhow you\u2019d use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-07-numeric-operations/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nEach expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates\nto a single value, which is then bound to a variable. [Appendix\nB][appendix_b]<!-- ignore --> contains a list of all operators that Rust\nprovides.\n\n#### The Boolean Type\n\nAs in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible\nvalues: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in\nRust is specified using `bool`. For example:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-08-boolean/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThe main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if`\nexpression. We\u2019ll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in the [\u201cControl\nFlow\u201d][control-flow]<!-- ignore --> section.\n\n#### The Character Type\n\nRust\u2019s `char` type is the language\u2019s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are\nsome examples of declaring `char` values:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-09-char/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nNote that we specify `char` literals with single quotation marks, as opposed to\nstring literals, which use double quotation marks. Rust\u2019s `char` type is 4\nbytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can\nrepresent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and\nKorean characters; emojis; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in\nRust. Unicode scalar values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to\n`U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a \u201ccharacter\u201d isn\u2019t really a concept in Unicode,\nso your human intuition for what a \u201ccharacter\u201d is may not match up with what a\n`char` is in Rust. We\u2019ll discuss this topic in detail in [\u201cStoring UTF-8\nEncoded Text with Strings\u201d][strings]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 8.",

Tuples have a fixed length: Once\ndeclared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.\n\nWe create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside\nparentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the\ndifferent values in the tuple don\u2019t have to be the same.

To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can\nuse pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-11-destructuring-tuples/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then\nuses a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate\nvariables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called _destructuring_ because it breaks\nthe single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of\n`y`, which is `6.4`.\n\nWe can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by\nthe index of the value we want to access. For example:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-12-tuple-indexing/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis program creates the tuple `x` and then accesses each element of the tuple\nusing their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first\nindex in a tuple is 0.\n\nThe tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_. This value and its\ncorresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an\nempty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don\u2019t\nreturn any other value.\n\n#### The Array Type\n\nAnother way to have a collection of multiple values is with an _array_. Unlike\na tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in\nsome other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.\n\nWe write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square\nbrackets:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-13-arrays/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nArrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack, the same as\nthe other types we have seen so far, rather than the heap (we will discuss the\nstack and the heap more in [Chapter 4][stack-and-heap]<!-- ignore -->) or when\nyou want to ensure that you always have a fixed number of elements. An array\nisn\u2019t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection\ntype provided by the standard library that _is_ allowed to grow or shrink in\nsize because its contents live on the heap. If you\u2019re unsure whether to use an\narray or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. [Chapter\n8][vectors]<!-- ignore --> discusses vectors in more detail.\n\nHowever, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not\nneed to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a\nprogram, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know\nit will always contain 12 elements:\n\n```rust\nlet months = [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\",\n              \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"];\n```\n\nYou write an array\u2019s type using square brackets with the type of each element,\na semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:\n\n```rust\nlet a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n```\n\nHere, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5`\nindicates the array contains five elements.\n\nYou can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by\nspecifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of\nthe array in square brackets, as shown here:\n\n```rust\nlet a = [3; 5];\n```\n\nThe array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value\n`3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a\nmore concise way.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n<a id=\"accessing-array-elements\"></a>\n\n#### Array Element Access\n\nAn array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be\nallocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,\nlike this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-14-array-indexing/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nIn this example, the variable named `first` will get the value `1` because that\nis the value at index `[0]` in the array. The variable named `second` will get\nthe value `2` from index `[1]` in the array.\n\n#### Invalid Array Element Access\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past\nthe end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in\nChapter 2, to get an array index from the user:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,panics\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-15-invalid-array-access/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis code compiles successfully. If you run this code using `cargo run` and\nenter `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the program will print out the corresponding\nvalue at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of\nthe array, such as `10`, you\u2019ll see output like this:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-15-invalid-array-access\ncargo run\n10\n-->\n\n```console\nthread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:19:19:\nindex out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n```\n\nThe program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid\nvalue in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and\ndidn\u2019t execute the final `println!` statement. When you attempt to access an\nelement using indexing, Rust will check that the index you\u2019ve specified is less\nthan the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length,\nRust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,\nbecause the compiler can\u2019t possibly know what value a user will enter when they\nrun the code later.\n\nThis is an example of Rust\u2019s memory safety principles in action. In many\nlow-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an\nincorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this\nkind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and\ncontinuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust\u2019s error handling and how you can\nwrite readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.\n\n[comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number]: ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number\n[twos-complement]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement\n[control-flow]: ch03-05-control-flow.html#control-flow\n[strings]: ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings\n[stack-and-heap]: ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap\n[vectors]: ch08-01-vectors.html\n[unrecoverable-errors-with-panic]: ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html\n[appendix_b]: appendix-02-operators.md",

    "content": "## Functions\n\nFunctions are prevalent in Rust code. You\u2019ve already seen one of the most\nimportant functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry\npoint of many programs. You\u2019ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to\ndeclare new functions.\n\nRust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable\nnames, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.\nHere\u2019s a program that contains an example function definition:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-16-functions/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWe define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and a\nset of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function\nbody begins and ends.\n\nWe can call any function we\u2019ve defined by entering its name followed by a set\nof parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be\ncalled from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function`\n_after_ the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before\nas well. Rust doesn\u2019t care where you define your functions, only that they\u2019re\ndefined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.\n\nLet\u2019s start a new binary project named _functions_ to explore functions\nfurther. Place the `another_function` example in _src/main.rs_ and run it. You\nshould see the following output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-16-functions/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function.\nFirst the \u201cHello, world!\u201d message prints, and then `another_function` is called\nand its message is printed.",

    "content": "We can define functions to have _parameters_, which are special variables that\nare part of a function\u2019s signature. When a function has parameters, you can\nprovide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete\nvalues are called _arguments_, but in casual conversation, people tend to use\nthe words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either the variables\nin a function\u2019s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a\nfunction.\n\nIn this version of `another_function` we add a parameter:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-17-functions-with-parameters/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nTry running this program; you should get the following output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-17-functions-with-parameters/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of\n`x` is specified as `i32`. When we pass `5` in to `another_function`, the\n`println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly brackets containing `x` was\nin the format string.\n\nIn function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter. This is\na deliberate decision in Rust\u2019s design: Requiring type annotations in function\ndefinitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in\nthe code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give\nmore-helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.\n\nWhen defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with\ncommas, like this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-18-functions-with-multiple-parameters/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis example creates a function named `print_labeled_measurement` with two\nparameters. The first parameter is named `value` and is an `i32`. The second is\nnamed `unit_label` and is type `char`. The function then prints text containing\nboth the `value` and the `unit_label`.\n\nLet\u2019s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your _functions_\nproject\u2019s _src/main.rs_ file with the preceding example and run it using `cargo\nrun`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-18-functions-with-multiple-parameters/output.txt}}\n```\n\nBecause we called the function with `5` as the value for `value` and `'h'` as\nthe value for `unit_label`, the program output contains those values.",

    "title": "Statements and Expressions",
    "content": "Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an\nexpression. So far, the functions we\u2019ve covered haven\u2019t included an ending\nexpression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because\nRust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to\nunderstand. Other languages don\u2019t have the same distinctions, so let\u2019s look at\nwhat statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies\nof functions.\n\n- _Statements_ are instructions that perform some action and do not return\n  a value.\n- _Expressions_ evaluate to a resultant value.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some examples.\n\nWe\u2019ve actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and\nassigning a value to it with the `let` keyword is a statement. In Listing 3-1,\n`let y = 6;` is a statement.\n\n<Listing number=\"3-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `main` function declaration containing one statement\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-01/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFunction definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a\nstatement in itself. (As we\u2019ll see shortly, calling a function is not a\nstatement, though.)\n\nStatements do not return values. Therefore, you can\u2019t assign a `let` statement\nto another variable, as the following code tries to do; you\u2019ll get an error:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-19-statements-vs-expressions/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, the error you\u2019ll get looks like this:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-19-statements-vs-expressions/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn\u2019t anything for\n`x` to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as\nC and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those\nlanguages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value\n`6`; that is not the case in Rust.\n\nExpressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that\nyou\u2019ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value `11`. Expressions can be part of\nstatements: In Listing 3-1, the `6` in the statement `let y = 6;` is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value `6`. Calling a function is an\nexpression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with\ncurly brackets is an expression, for example:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-20-blocks-are-expressions/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis expression:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{\n    let x = 3;\n    x + 1\n}\n```\n\nis a block that, in this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to `y`\nas part of the `let` statement. Note the `x + 1` line without a semicolon at\nthe end, which is unlike most of the lines you\u2019ve seen so far. Expressions do\nnot include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an\nexpression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.\nKeep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.",

    "content": "Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don\u2019t name return\nvalues, but we must declare their type after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the\nreturn value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final\nexpression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a\nfunction by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value, but most\nfunctions return the last expression implicitly. Here\u2019s an example of a\nfunction that returns a value:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-21-function-return-values/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThere are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five`\nfunction\u2014just the number `5` by itself. That\u2019s a perfectly valid function in\nRust. Note that the function\u2019s return type is specified too, as `-> i32`. Try\nrunning this code; the output should look like this:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-21-function-return-values/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe `5` in `five` is the function\u2019s return value, which is why the return type\nis `i32`. Let\u2019s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:\nFirst, the line `let x = five();` shows that we\u2019re using the return value of a\nfunction to initialize a variable. Because the function `five` returns a `5`,\nthat line is the same as the following:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\n```\n\nSecond, the `five` function has no parameters and defines the type of the\nreturn value, but the body of the function is a lonely `5` with no semicolon\nbecause it\u2019s an expression whose value we want to return.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-22-function-parameter-and-return/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nRunning this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. But what happens if we\nplace a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from\nan expression to a statement?\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-23-statements-dont-return-values/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nCompiling this code will produce an error, as follows:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-23-statements-dont-return-values/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe main error message, `mismatched types`, reveals the core issue with this\ncode. The definition of the function `plus_one` says that it will return an\n`i32`, but statements don\u2019t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by `()`,\nthe unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function\ndefinition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to\npossibly help rectify this issue: It suggests removing the semicolon, which\nwould fix the error.",

For example, try running the\nfollowing code:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-28-if-condition-must-be-bool/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThe `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time, and Rust throws an\nerror:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-28-if-condition-must-be-bool/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error indicates that Rust expected a `bool` but got an integer. Unlike\nlanguages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to\nconvert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide\n`if` with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the `if` code block to run\nonly when a number is not equal to `0`, for example, we can change the `if`\nexpression to the following:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-29-if-not-equal-0/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nRunning this code will print `number was something other than zero`.\n\n#### Handling Multiple Conditions with `else if`\n\nYou can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if`\nexpression. For example:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-30-else-if/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should\nsee the following output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-30-else-if/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWhen this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and executes\nthe first body for which the condition evaluates to `true`. Note that even\nthough 6 is divisible by 2, we don\u2019t see the output `number is divisible by 2`,\nnor do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the `else`\nblock. That\u2019s because Rust only executes the block for the first `true`\ncondition, and once it finds one, it doesn\u2019t even check the rest.\n\nUsing too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more\nthan one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful\nRust branching construct called `match` for these cases.\n\n#### Using `if` in a `let` Statement\n\nBecause `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let`\nstatement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"3-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Assigning the result of an `if` expression to a variable\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-02/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if`\nexpression. Run this code to see what happens:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-02/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRemember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and\nnumbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the\nwhole `if` expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the\nvalues that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be\nthe same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the `if` arm and the `else`\narm were `i32` integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following\nexample, we\u2019ll get an error:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-31-arms-must-return-same-type/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWhen we try to compile this code, we\u2019ll get an error. The `if` and `else` arms\nhave value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to\nfind the problem in the program:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-31-arms-must-return-same-type/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe expression in the `if` block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in\nthe `else` block evaluates to a string. This won\u2019t work, because variables must\nhave a single type, and Rust needs to know definitively at compile time what\ntype the `number` variable is. Knowing the type of `number` lets the compiler\nverify the type is valid everywhere we use `number`. Rust wouldn\u2019t be able to\ndo that if the type of `number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler\nwould be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had\nto keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.",

    "title": "Repetition with Loops",
    "content": "It\u2019s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,\nRust provides several _loops_, which will run through the code inside the loop\nbody to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To experiment\nwith loops, let\u2019s make a new project called _loops_.\n\nRust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Let\u2019s try each one.\n\n#### Repeating Code with `loop`\n\nThe `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again\neither forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.\n\nAs an example, change the _src/main.rs_ file in your _loops_ directory to look\nlike this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-loop/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWhen we run this program, we\u2019ll see `again!` printed over and over continuously\nuntil we stop the program manually. Most terminals support the keyboard shortcut\n<kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt a program that is stuck in a continual\nloop. Give it a try:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-loop\ncargo run\nCTRL-C\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s\n     Running `target/debug/loops`\nagain!\nagain!\nagain!\nagain!\n^Cagain!\n```\n\nThe symbol `^C` represents where you pressed <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.\n\nYou may or may not see the word `again!` printed after the `^C`, depending on\nwhere the code was in the loop when it received the interrupt signal.\n\nFortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You\ncan place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop\nexecuting the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the\n[\u201cQuitting After a Correct Guess\u201d][quitting-after-a-correct-guess]<!-- ignore\n--> section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when the user won the game by\nguessing the correct number.\n\nWe also used `continue` in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program\nto skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the\nnext iteration.\n\n#### Returning Values from Loops\n\nOne of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such\nas checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass\nthe result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do\nthis, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you\nuse to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so that you\ncan use it, as shown here:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-33-return-value-from-loop/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nBefore the loop, we declare a variable named `counter` and initialize it to\n`0`. Then, we declare a variable named `result` to hold the value returned from\nthe loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add `1` to the `counter` variable,\nand then check whether the `counter` is equal to `10`. When it is, we use the\n`break` keyword with the value `counter * 2`. After the loop, we use a\nsemicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to `result`. Finally, we\nprint the value in `result`, which in this case is `20`.\n\nYou can also `return` from inside a loop. While `break` only exits the current\nloop, `return` always exits the current function.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n<a id=\"loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops\"></a>\n\n#### Disambiguating with Loop Labels\n\nIf you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost\nloop at that point. You can optionally specify a _loop label_ on a loop that\nyou can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords\napply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin\nwith a single quote. Here\u2019s an example with two nested loops:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-5-loop-labels/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThe outer loop has the label `'counting_up`, and it will count up from 0 to 2.\nThe inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first `break` that\ndoesn\u2019t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The `break\n'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:\n\n```console\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-5-loop-labels/output.txt}}\n```\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n<a id=\"conditional-loops-with-while\"></a>\n\n#### Streamlining Conditional Loops with while\n\nA program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the\ncondition is `true`, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be `true`, the\nprogram calls `break`, stopping the loop. It\u2019s possible to implement behavior\nlike this using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`; you could\ntry that now in a program, if you\u2019d like. However, this pattern is so common\nthat Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a `while` loop. In\nListing 3-3, we use `while` to loop the program three times, counting down each\ntime, and then, after the loop, to print a message and exit.\n\n<Listing number=\"3-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using a `while` loop to run code while a condition evaluates to `true`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-03/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used\n`loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it\u2019s clearer. While a condition\nevaluates to `true`, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.\n\n#### Looping Through a Collection with `for`\n\nYou can choose to use the `while` construct to loop over the elements of a\ncollection, such as an array. For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each\nelement in the array `a`.\n\n<Listing number=\"3-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Looping through each element of a collection using a `while` loop\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-04/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index\n`0` and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,\nwhen `index < 5` is no longer `true`). Running this code will print every\nelement in the array:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-04/output.txt}}\n```\n\nAll five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though `index`\nwill reach a value of `5` at some point, the loop stops executing before trying\nto fetch a sixth value from the array.\n\nHowever, this approach is error-prone; we could cause the program to panic if\nthe index value or test condition is incorrect. For example, if you changed the\ndefinition of the `a` array to have four elements but forgot to update the\ncondition to `while index < 4`, the code would panic. It\u2019s also slow, because\nthe compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the\nindex is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.\n\nAs a more concise alternative, you can use a `for` loop and execute some code\nfor each item in a collection. A `for` loop looks like the code in Listing 3-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"3-5\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Looping through each element of a collection using a `for` loop\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/listing-03-05/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we run this code, we\u2019ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More\nimportantly, we\u2019ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the\nchance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not\ngoing far enough and missing some items. Machine code generated from `for`\nloops can be more efficient as well because the index doesn\u2019t need to be\ncompared to the length of the array at every iteration.\n\nUsing the `for` loop, you wouldn\u2019t need to remember to change any other code if\nyou changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method\nused in Listing 3-4.\n\nThe safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used loop\nconstruct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a\ncertain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a `while` loop\nin Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a `for` loop. The way to do that\nwould be to use a `Range`, provided by the standard library, which generates\nall numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another\nnumber.\n\nHere\u2019s what the countdown would look like using a `for` loop and another method\nwe\u2019ve not yet talked about, `rev`, to reverse the range:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-34-for-range/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis code is a bit nicer, isn\u2019t it?\n\n## Summary\n\nYou made it! This was a sizable chapter: You learned about variables, scalar\nand compound data types, functions, comments, `if` expressions, and loops!

    "content": "## What Is Ownership?\n\n_Ownership_ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.\nAll programs have to manage the way they use a computer\u2019s memory while running.\nSome languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used\nmemory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly\nallocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: Memory is managed\nthrough a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If\nany of the rules are violated, the program won\u2019t compile. None of the features\nof ownership will slow down your program while it\u2019s running.\n\nBecause ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time\nto get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust\nand the rules of the ownership system, the easier you\u2019ll find it to naturally\ndevelop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!\n\nWhen you understand ownership, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation for understanding\nthe features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn ownership by\nworking through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:\nstrings.\n\n> ### The Stack and the Heap\n>\n> Many programming languages don\u2019t require you to think about the stack and the\n> heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a\n> value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why\n> you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in\n> relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief\n> explanation in preparation.\n>\n> Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use\n> at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores\n> values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite\n> order. This is referred to as _last in, first out (LIFO)_. Think of a stack of\n> plates: When you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when\n> you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from\n> the middle or bottom wouldn\u2019t work as well! Adding data is called _pushing\n> onto the stack_, and removing data is called _popping off the stack_. All\n> data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown\n> size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap\n> instead.\n>\n> The heap is less organized: When you put data on the heap, you request a\n> certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap\n> that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_, which\n> is the address of that location. This process is called _allocating on the\n> heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values onto\n> the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a\n> known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want\n> the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a\n> restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and\n> the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If\n> someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you\u2019ve been seated to\n> find you.\n>\n> Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the\n> allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is\n> always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap\n> requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space\n> to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next\n> allocation.\n>\n> Accessing data in the heap is generally slower than accessing data on the\n> stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary\n> processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the\n> analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables.\n> It\u2019s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to\n> the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B,\n> then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower\n> process. By the same token, a processor can usually do its job better if it\n> works on data that\u2019s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than\n> farther away (as it can be on the heap).\n>\n> When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function\n> (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function\u2019s\n> local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those\n> values get popped off the stack.\n>\n> Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,\n> minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused\n> data on the heap so that you don\u2019t run out of space are all problems that\n> ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won\u2019t need to think\n> about the stack and the heap very often. But knowing that the main purpose of\n> ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it\n> does.",

As a result, our examples\nwill be a bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than\nboilerplate code.\n\nAs a first example of ownership, we\u2019ll look at the scope of some variables. A\n_scope_ is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the\nfollowing variable:\n\n```rust\nlet s = \"hello\";\n```\n\nThe variable `s` refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is\nhardcoded into the text of our program.

But we want to\nlook at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to\nclean up that data, and the `String` type is a great example.\n\nWe\u2019ll concentrate on the parts of `String` that relate to ownership.

This type manages\ndata allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that\nis unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String` from a string\nliteral using the `from` function, like so:\n\n```rust\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\n```\n\nThe double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from`\nfunction under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like\n`string_from`. We\u2019ll discuss this syntax more in the [\u201cMethods\u201d][methods]<!--\nignore --> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk about namespacing with\nmodules in [\u201cPaths for Referring to an Item in the Module\nTree\u201d][paths-module-tree]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.\n\nThis kind of string _can_ be mutated:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-01-can-mutate-string/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nSo, what\u2019s the difference here? Why can `String` be mutated but literals\ncannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.",

    "content": "In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the\ntext is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string\nliterals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string\nliteral\u2019s immutability. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t put a blob of memory into the\nbinary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose\nsize might change while running the program.\n\nWith the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,\nwe need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,\nto hold the contents. This means:\n\n- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.\n- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we\u2019re done with\n  our `String`.\n\nThat first part is done by us: When we call `String::from`, its implementation\nrequests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming\nlanguages.\n\nHowever, the second part is different. In languages with a _garbage collector\n(GC)_, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn\u2019t being used\nanymore, and we don\u2019t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,\nit\u2019s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to\ncall code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this\ncorrectly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,\nwe\u2019ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we\u2019ll have an invalid variable. If\nwe do it twice, that\u2019s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with\nexactly one `free`.\n\nRust takes a different path: The memory is automatically returned once the\nvariable that owns it goes out of scope. Here\u2019s a version of our scope example\nfrom Listing 4-1 using a `String` instead of a string literal:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-02-string-scope/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThere is a natural point at which we can return the memory our `String` needs\nto the allocator: when `s` goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of\nscope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called\n`drop`, and it\u2019s where the author of `String` can put\nthe code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing\ncurly bracket.\n\n> Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item\u2019s\n> lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_.\n> The `drop` function in Rust will be familiar to you if you\u2019ve used RAII\n> patterns.\n\nThis pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem\nsimple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more\ncomplicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data\nwe\u2019ve allocated on the heap. Let\u2019s explore some of those situations now.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ways-variables-and-data-interact-move\"></a>\n\n#### Variables and Data Interacting with Move\n\nMultiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.\nListing 4-2 shows an example using an integer.\n\n<Listing number=\"4-2\" caption=\"Assigning the integer value of variable `x` to `y`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe can probably guess what this is doing: \u201cBind the value `5` to `x`; then, make\na copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`.\u201d We now have two variables, `x`\nand `y`, and both equal `5`. This is indeed what is happening, because integers\nare simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed\nonto the stack.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the `String` version:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-03-string-move/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the\nsame: That is, the second line would make a copy of the value in `s1` and bind\nit to `s2`. But this isn\u2019t quite what happens.\n\nTake a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to `String` under the\ncovers. A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to\nthe memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.\nThis group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the\nheap that holds the contents.\n\n<img alt=\"Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the\nstack, consisting of its length (5), capacity (5), and a pointer to the first\nvalue in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the\nstring data on the heap, byte by byte.\" src=\"img/trpl04-01.svg\" class=\"center\"\nstyle=\"width: 50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-1: The representation in memory of a `String`\nholding the value `\"hello\"` bound to `s1`</span>\n\nThe length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` are\ncurrently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the\n`String` has received from the allocator. The difference between length and\ncapacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it\u2019s fine to ignore the\ncapacity.\n\nWhen we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the\npointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the\ndata on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data\nrepresentation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.\n\n<img alt=\"Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the\nstack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.\"\nsrc=\"img/trpl04-02.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-2: The representation in memory of the variable\n`s2` that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of `s1`</span>\n\nThe representation does _not_ look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would\nlook like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the\noperation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if\nthe data on the heap were large.\n\n<img alt=\"Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,\nand each points to its own copy of string data on the heap.\"\nsrc=\"img/trpl04-03.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what `s2 = s1` might\ndo if Rust copied the heap data as well</span>\n\nEarlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically\ncalls the `drop` function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But\nFigure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a\nproblem: When `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the\nsame memory. This is known as a _double free_ error and is one of the memory\nsafety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory\ncorruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1;`, Rust considers `s1` as\nno longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn\u2019t need to free anything when `s1` goes\nout of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use `s1` after `s2` is\ncreated; it won\u2019t work:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-04-cant-use-after-move/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nYou\u2019ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the\ninvalidated reference:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-04-cant-use-after-move/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard the terms _shallow copy_ and _deep copy_ while working with\nother languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity\nwithout copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But\nbecause Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a\nshallow copy, it\u2019s known as a _move_. In this example, we would say that `s1`\nwas _moved_ into `s2`. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.\n\n<img alt=\"Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the\nstack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.\nTable s1 is grayed out because s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to\naccess the heap data.\" src=\"img/trpl04-04.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width:\n50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-4: The representation in memory after `s1` has\nbeen invalidated</span>\n\nThat solves our problem! With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope it\nalone will free the memory, and we\u2019re done.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s a design choice that\u2019s implied by this: Rust will never\nautomatically create \u201cdeep\u201d copies of your data. Therefore, any _automatic_\ncopying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.\n\n#### Scope and Assignment\n\nThe inverse of this is true for the relationship between scoping, ownership, and\nmemory being freed via the `drop` function as well. When you assign a completely\nnew value to an existing variable, Rust will call `drop` and free the original\nvalue\u2019s memory immediately. Consider this code, for example:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-04b-replacement-drop/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe initially declare a variable `s` and bind it to a `String` with the value\n`\"hello\"`. Then, we immediately create a new `String` with the value `\"ahoy\"`\nand assign it to `s`. At this point, nothing is referring to the original value\non the heap at all. Figure 4-5 illustrates the stack and heap data now:\n\n<img alt=\"One table representing the string value on the stack, pointing to\nthe second piece of string data (ahoy) on the heap, with the original string\ndata (hello) grayed out because it cannot be accessed anymore.\"\nsrc=\"img/trpl04-05.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-5: The representation in memory after the initial\nvalue has been replaced in its entirety</span>\n\nThe original string thus immediately goes out of scope. Rust will run the `drop`\nfunction on it and its memory will be freed right away. When we print the value\nat the end, it will be `\"ahoy, world!\"`.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone\"></a>\n\n#### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone\n\nIf we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the\nstack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. We\u2019ll discuss method\nsyntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many\nprogramming languages, you\u2019ve probably seen them before.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the `clone` method in action:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-05-clone/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,\nwhere the heap data _does_ get copied.\n\nWhen you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being\nexecuted and that code may be expensive. It\u2019s a visual indicator that something\ndifferent is going on.\n\n#### Stack-Only Data: Copy\n\nThere\u2019s another wrinkle we haven\u2019t talked about yet. This code using\nintegers\u2014part of which was shown in Listing 4-2\u2014works and is valid:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-06-copy/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nBut this code seems to contradict what we just learned: We don\u2019t have a call to\n`clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn\u2019t moved into `y`.\n\nThe reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile\ntime are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick\nto make. That means there\u2019s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being\nvalid after we create the variable `y`. In other words, there\u2019s no difference\nbetween deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn\u2019t do anything\ndifferent from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.\n\nRust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on\ntypes that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we\u2019ll talk more about\ntraits in [Chapter 10][traits]<!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the `Copy`\ntrait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,\nmaking them still valid after assignment to another variable.\n\nRust won\u2019t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts,\nhas implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen\nwhen the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type,\nwe\u2019ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation\nto your type to implement the trait, see [\u201cDerivable\nTraits\u201d][derivable-traits]<!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.\n\nSo, what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for\nthe given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar\nvalues can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some\nform of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that\nimplement `Copy`:\n\n- All the integer types, such as `u32`.\n- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.\n- All the floating-point types, such as `f64`.\n- The character type, `char`.\n- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example,\n  `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.",

Instead, we can provide a reference to the `String` value.\nA reference is like a pointer in that it\u2019s an address we can follow to access\nthe data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.\nUnlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a\nparticular type for the life of that reference.\n\nHere is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a\nreference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-07-reference/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the\nfunction return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into\n`calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than\n`String`. These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to\nsome value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-6 depicts this concept.\n\n<img alt=\"Three tables: the table for s contains only a pointer to the table\nfor s1.

We\u2019ll see some uses of the\n> dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in\n> Chapter 15.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the function call here:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-07-reference/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1`\nbut does not own it. Because the reference does not own it, the value it points\nto will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.\n\nLikewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of\nthe parameter `s` is a reference. Let\u2019s add some explanatory annotations:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-08-reference-with-annotations/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function\nparameter\u2019s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped\nwhen `s` stops being used, because `s` doesn\u2019t have ownership. When functions\nhave references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won\u2019t need to\nreturn the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had\nownership.\n\nWe call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_. As in real life, if a\nperson owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you\u2019re done, you have\nto give it back. You don\u2019t own it.\n\nSo, what happens if we try to modify something we\u2019re borrowing? Try the code in\nListing 4-6.

A _data race_ is similar to a race\ncondition and happens when these three behaviors occur:\n\n- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.\n- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.\n- There\u2019s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.\n\nData races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix\nwhen you\u2019re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by\nrefusing to compile code with data races!\n\nAs always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for\nmultiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-11-muts-in-separate-scopes/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nRust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.\nThis code results in an error:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-12-immutable-and-mutable-not-allowed/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nHere\u2019s the error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-12-immutable-and-mutable-not-allowed/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWhew! We _also_ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one\nto the same value.\n\nUsers of an immutable reference don\u2019t expect the value to suddenly change out\nfrom under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no\none who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else\u2019s\nreading of the data.\n\nNote that a reference\u2019s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues\nthrough the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will\ncompile because the last usage of the immutable references is in the `println!`,\nbefore the mutable reference is introduced:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-13-reference-scope-ends/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!`\nwhere they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is\ncreated. These scopes don\u2019t overlap, so this code is allowed: The compiler can\ntell that the reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of\nthe scope.\n\nEven though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it\u2019s\nthe Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather\nthan at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then, you don\u2019t\nhave to track down why your data isn\u2019t what you thought it was.",

A slice is a kind\nof reference, so it does not have ownership.\n\nHere\u2019s a small programming problem: Write a function that takes a string of\nwords separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string.\nIf the function doesn\u2019t find a space in the string, the whole string must be\none word, so the entire string should be returned.\n\n> Note: For the purposes of introducing slices, we are assuming ASCII only in\n> this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the\n> [\u201cStoring UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings\u201d][strings]<!-- ignore --> section\n> of Chapter 8.\n\nLet\u2019s work through how we\u2019d write the signature of this function without using\nslices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word(s: &String) -> ?\n```\n\nThe `first_word` function has a parameter of type `&String`. We don\u2019t need\nownership, so this is fine. (In idiomatic Rust, functions do not take ownership\nof their arguments unless they need to, and the reasons for that will become\nclear as we keep going.) But what should we return? We don\u2019t really have a way\nto talk about *part* of a string. However, we could return the index of the end\nof the word, indicated by a space. Let\u2019s try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.\n\n<Listing number=\"4-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The `first_word` function that returns a byte index value into the `String` parameter\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-07/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nBecause we need to go through the `String` element by element and check whether\na value is a space, we\u2019ll convert our `String` to an array of bytes using the\n`as_bytes` method.\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-07/src/main.rs:as_bytes}}\n```\n\nNext, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the `iter` method:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-07/src/main.rs:iter}}\n```\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss iterators in more detail in [Chapter 13][ch13]<!-- ignore -->.\nFor now, know that `iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection\nand that `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as\npart of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from\n`enumerate` is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element.\nThis is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.\n\nBecause the `enumerate` method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to\ndestructure that tuple. We\u2019ll be discussing patterns more in [Chapter\n6][ch6]<!-- ignore -->. In the `for` loop, we specify a pattern that has `i`\nfor the index in the tuple and `&item` for the single byte in the tuple.\nBecause we get a reference to the element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use\n`&` in the pattern.\n\nInside the `for` loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by\nusing the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position.\nOtherwise, we return the length of the string by using `s.len()`.\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-07/src/main.rs:inside_for}}\n```\n\nWe now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the\nstring, but there\u2019s a problem. We\u2019re returning a `usize` on its own, but it\u2019s\nonly a meaningful number in the context of the `&String`. In other words,\nbecause it\u2019s a separate value from the `String`, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\nwill still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that\nuses the `first_word` function from Listing 4-7.\n\n<Listing number=\"4-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Storing the result from calling the `first_word` function and then changing the `String` contents\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used `word`\nafter calling `s.clear()`. Because `word` isn\u2019t connected to the state of `s`\nat all, `word` still contains the value `5`. We could use that value `5` with\nthe variable `s` to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug\nbecause the contents of `s` have changed since we saved `5` in `word`.\n\nHaving to worry about the index in `word` getting out of sync with the data in\n`s` is tedious and error-prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if\nwe write a `second_word` function. Its signature would have to look like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {\n```\n\nNow we\u2019re tracking a starting _and_ an ending index, and we have even more\nvalues that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren\u2019t tied to\nthat state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need\nto be kept in sync.\n\nLuckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.",

We create slices\nusing a range within square brackets by specifying\n`[starting_index..ending_index]`, where _`starting_index`_ is the first\nposition in the slice and _`ending_index`_ is one more than the last position\nin the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position\nand the length of the slice, which corresponds to _`ending_index`_ minus\n_`starting_index`_. So, in the case of `let world = &s[6..11];`, `world` would\nbe a slice that contains a pointer to the byte at index 6 of `s` with a length\nvalue of `5`.\n\nFigure 4-7 shows this in a diagram.\n\n<img alt=\"Three tables: a table representing the stack data of s, which points\nto the byte at index 0 in a table of the string data &quot;hello world&quot; on\nthe heap.

In other words, these are equal:\n\n```rust\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\nlet slice = &s[0..2];\nlet slice = &s[..2];\n```\n\nBy the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the `String`, you\ncan drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:\n\n```rust\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\nlet len = s.len();\n\nlet slice = &s[3..len];\nlet slice = &s[3..];\n```\n\nYou can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So, these\nare equal:\n\n```rust\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\nlet len = s.len();\n\nlet slice = &s[0..len];\nlet slice = &s[..];\n```\n\n> Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character\n> boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a\n> multibyte character, your program will exit with an error.\n\nWith all this information in mind, let\u2019s rewrite `first_word` to return a\nslice. The type that signifies \u201cstring slice\u201d is written as `&str`:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-18-first-word-slice/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing 4-7, by\nlooking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we return a\nstring slice using the start of the string and the index of the space as the\nstarting and ending indices.\n\nNow when we call `first_word`, we get back a single value that is tied to the\nunderlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of\nthe slice and the number of elements in the slice.\n\nReturning a slice would also work for a `second_word` function:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {\n```\n\nWe now have a straightforward API that\u2019s much harder to mess up because the\ncompiler will ensure that the references into the `String` remain valid.\nRemember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the\nend of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid?\nThat code was logically incorrect but didn\u2019t show any immediate errors. The\nproblems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with\nan emptied string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know much sooner\nthat we have a problem with our code. Using the slice version of `first_word`\nwill throw a compile-time error:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-19-slice-error/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere\u2019s the compiler error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-19-slice-error/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRecall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to\nsomething, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because `clear` needs to\ntruncate the `String`, it needs to get a mutable reference. The `println!`\nafter the call to `clear` uses the reference in `word`, so the immutable\nreference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable\nreference in `clear` and the immutable reference in `word` from existing at the\nsame time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use,\nbut it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"string-literals-are-slices\"></a>\n\n#### String Literals as Slices\n\nRecall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now\nthat we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:\n\n```rust\nlet s = \"Hello, world!\";\n```\n\nThe type of `s` here is `&str`: It\u2019s a slice pointing to that specific point of\nthe binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; `&str` is an\nimmutable reference.\n\n#### String Slices as Parameters\n\nKnowing that you can take slices of literals and `String` values leads us to\none more improvement on `first_word`, and that\u2019s its signature:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {\n```\n\nA more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9\ninstead because it allows us to use the same function on both `&String` values\nand `&str` values.\n\n<Listing number=\"4-9\" caption=\"Improving the `first_word` function by using a string slice for the type of the `s` parameter\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-09/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf we have a string slice, we can pass that directly.

    "content": "## Defining and Instantiating Structs\n\nStructs are similar to tuples, discussed in [\u201cThe Tuple Type\u201d][tuples]<!--\nignore --> section, in that both hold multiple related values. Like tuples, the\npieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct\nyou\u2019ll name each piece of data so it\u2019s clear what the values mean. Adding these\nnames means that structs are more flexible than tuples: You don\u2019t have to rely\non the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.\n\nTo define a struct, we enter the keyword `struct` and name the entire struct. A\nstruct\u2019s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being\ngrouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of\nthe pieces of data, which we call _fields_. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a\nstruct that stores information about a user account.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `User` struct definition\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-01/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo use a struct after we\u2019ve defined it, we create an _instance_ of that struct\nby specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by\nstating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing _`key:\nvalue`_ pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the\ndata we want to store in those fields. We don\u2019t have to specify the fields in\nthe same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the\nstruct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill\nin that template with particular data to create values of the type. For\nexample, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating an instance of the `User` struct\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to\naccess this user\u2019s email address, we use `user1.email`. If the instance is\nmutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a\nparticular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the `email`\nfield of a mutable `User` instance.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Changing the value in the `email` field of a `User` instance\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn\u2019t allow us to mark\nonly certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new\ninstance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to\nimplicitly return that new instance.\n\nListing 5-4 shows a `build_user` function that returns a `User` instance with\nthe given email and username. The `active` field gets the value `true`, and the\n`sign_in_count` gets a value of `1`.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `build_user` function that takes an email and username and returns a `User` instance\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIt makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct\nfields, but having to repeat the `email` and `username` field names and\nvariables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name\nwould get even more annoying. Luckily, there\u2019s a convenient shorthand!\n\n<!-- Old headings.

We set a new value for `email` but\notherwise use the same values from `user1` that we created in Listing 5-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating a new `User` instance using all but one of the values from `user1`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nUsing struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as\nshown in Listing 5-7. The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not\nexplicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using struct update syntax to set a new `email` value for a `User` instance but to use the rest of the values from `user1`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-07/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in `user2` that has a\ndifferent value for `email` but has the same values for the `username`,\n`active`, and `sign_in_count` fields from `user1`. The `..user1` must come last\nto specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the\ncorresponding fields in `user1`, but we can choose to specify values for as\nmany fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in\nthe struct\u2019s definition.\n\nNote that the struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment; this is because\nit moves the data, just as we saw in the [\u201cVariables and Data Interacting with\nMove\u201d][move]<!-- ignore --> section. In this example, we can no longer use\n`user1` after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of\n`user1` was moved into `user2`. If we had given `user2` new `String` values for\nboth `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count`\nvalues from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`.\nBoth `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait, so\nthe behavior we discussed in the [\u201cStack-Only Data: Copy\u201d][copy]<!-- ignore -->\nsection would apply.

Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name\nand make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each\nfield as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.\n\nTo define a tuple struct, start with the `struct` keyword and the struct name\nfollowed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two\ntuple structs named `Color` and `Point`:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-01-tuple-structs/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that the `black` and `origin` values are different types because they\u2019re\ninstances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,\neven though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For\nexample, a function that takes a parameter of type `Color` cannot take a\n`Point` as an argument, even though both types are made up of three `i32`\nvalues. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can\ndestructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a `.` followed\nby the index to access an individual value. Unlike tuples, tuple structs\nrequire you to name the type of the struct when you destructure them.

We\u2019ll start by using single variables and\nthen refactor the program until we\u2019re using structs instead.\n\nLet\u2019s make a new binary project with Cargo called _rectangles_ that will take\nthe width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area\nof the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing\nexactly that in our project\u2019s _src/main.rs_.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Calculating the area of a rectangle specified by separate width and height variables\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNow, run this program using `cargo run`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the\n`area` function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code clear\nand readable.\n\nThe issue with this code is evident in the signature of `area`:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe `area` function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the\nfunction we wrote has two parameters, and it\u2019s not clear anywhere in our\nprogram that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more\nmanageable to group width and height together.

Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and\nwe\u2019re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less\nclear: Tuples don\u2019t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of\nthe tuple, making our calculation less obvious.\n\nMixing up the width and height wouldn\u2019t matter for the area calculation, but if\nwe want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have to\nkeep in mind that `width` is the tuple index `0` and `height` is the tuple\nindex `1`. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in\nmind if they were to use our code.

Inside the curly\nbrackets, we defined the fields as `width` and `height`, both of which have\ntype `u32`. Then, in `main`, we created a particular instance of `Rectangle`\nthat has a width of `30` and a height of `50`.\n\nOur `area` function is now defined with one parameter, which we\u2019ve named\n`rectangle`, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct `Rectangle`\ninstance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than\ntake ownership of it. This way, `main` retains its ownership and can continue\nusing `rect1`, which is the reason we use the `&` in the function signature and\nwhere we call the function.\n\nThe `area` function accesses the `width` and `height` fields of the `Rectangle`\ninstance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance does not\nmove the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs). Our\nfunction signature for `area` now says exactly what we mean: Calculate the area\nof `Rectangle`, using its `width` and `height` fields. This conveys that the\nwidth and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to\nthe values rather than using the tuple index values of `0` and `1`.

The primitive types we\u2019ve seen so far\nimplement `Display` by default because there\u2019s only one way you\u2019d want to show\na `1` or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way\n`println!` should format the output is less clear because there are more\ndisplay possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the\ncurly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust\ndoesn\u2019t try to guess what we want, and structs don\u2019t have a provided\nimplementation of `Display` to use with `println!` and the `{}` placeholder.\n\nIf we continue reading the errors, we\u2019ll find this helpful note:\n\n```text\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-11/output.txt:9:10}}\n```\n\nLet\u2019s try it! The `println!` macro call will now look like `println!(\"rect1 is\n{rect1:?}\");`. Putting the specifier `:?` inside the curly brackets tells\n`println!` we want to use an output format called `Debug`. The `Debug` trait\nenables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so that\nwe can see its value while we\u2019re debugging our code.\n\nCompile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:\n\n```text\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-01-debug/output.txt:3}}\n```\n\nBut again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:\n\n```text\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-01-debug/output.txt:9:10}}\n```\n\nRust _does_ include functionality to print out debugging information, but we\nhave to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct.\nTo do that, we add the outer attribute `#[derive(Debug)]` just before the\nstruct definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-12\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Adding the attribute to derive the `Debug` trait and printing the `Rectangle` instance using debug formatting\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-12/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNow when we run the program, we won\u2019t get any errors, and we\u2019ll see the\nfollowing output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-12/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNice! It\u2019s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields\nfor this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have\nlarger structs, it\u2019s useful to have output that\u2019s a bit easier to read; in\nthose cases, we can use `{:#?}` instead of `{:?}` in the `println!` string. In\nthis example, using the `{:#?}` style will output the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-02-pretty-debug/output.txt}}\n```\n\nAnother way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is to use the [`dbg!`\nmacro][dbg]<!-- ignore -->, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed\nto `println!`, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of\nwhere that `dbg!` macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value\nof that expression, and returns ownership of the value.\n\n> Note: Calling the `dbg!` macro prints to the standard error console stream\n> (`stderr`), as opposed to `println!`, which prints to the standard output\n> console stream (`stdout`). We\u2019ll talk more about `stderr` and `stdout` in the\n> [\u201cRedirecting Errors to Standard Error\u201d section in Chapter\n> 12][err]<!-- ignore -->.\n\nHere\u2019s an example where we\u2019re interested in the value that gets assigned to the\n`width` field, as well as the value of the whole struct in `rect1`:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-05-dbg-macro/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nWe can put `dbg!` around the expression `30 * scale` and, because `dbg!`\nreturns ownership of the expression\u2019s value, the `width` field will get the\nsame value as if we didn\u2019t have the `dbg!` call there. We don\u2019t want `dbg!` to\ntake ownership of `rect1`, so we use a reference to `rect1` in the next call.\nHere\u2019s what the output of this example looks like:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-05-dbg-macro/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWe can see the first bit of output came from _src/main.rs_ line 10 where we\u2019re\ndebugging the expression `30 * scale`, and its resultant value is `60` (the\n`Debug` formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The\n`dbg!` call on line 14 of _src/main.rs_ outputs the value of `&rect1`, which is\nthe `Rectangle` struct. This output uses the pretty `Debug` formatting of the\n`Rectangle` type. The `dbg!` macro can be really helpful when you\u2019re trying to\nfigure out what your code is doing!\n\nIn addition to the `Debug` trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us\nto use with the `derive` attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom\ntypes. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in [Appendix C][app-c]<!--\nignore -->. We\u2019ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as\nwell as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many\nattributes other than `derive`; for more information, see [the \u201cAttributes\u201d\nsection of the Rust Reference][attributes].\n\nOur `area` function is very specific: It only computes the area of rectangles.\nIt would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our `Rectangle` struct\nbecause it won\u2019t work with any other type. Let\u2019s look at how we can continue to\nrefactor this code by turning the `area` function into an `area` method\ndefined on our `Rectangle` type.\n\n[the-tuple-type]: ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type\n[app-c]: appendix-03-derivable-traits.md\n[println]: ../std/macro.println.html\n[dbg]: ../std/macro.dbg.html\n[err]: ch12-06-writing-to-stderr-instead-of-stdout.html\n[attributes]: ../reference/attributes.html",

Unlike functions,\nmethods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait\nobject, which we cover in [Chapter 6][enums]<!-- ignore --> and [Chapter\n18][trait-objects]<!-- ignore -->, respectively), and their first parameter is\nalways `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being\ncalled on.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Let\u2019s change the `area` function that has a `Rectangle` instance as a parameter\nand instead make an `area` method defined on the `Rectangle` struct, as shown\nin Listing 5-13.\n\n<Listing number=\"5-13\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Defining an `area` method on the `Rectangle` struct\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-13/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo define the function within the context of `Rectangle`, we start an `impl`\n(implementation) block for `Rectangle`. Everything within this `impl` block\nwill be associated with the `Rectangle` type. Then, we move the `area` function\nwithin the `impl` curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only)\nparameter to be `self` in the signature and everywhere within the body. In\n`main`, where we called the `area` function and passed `rect1` as an argument,\nwe can instead use _method syntax_ to call the `area` method on our `Rectangle`\ninstance. The method syntax goes after an instance: We add a dot followed by\nthe method name, parentheses, and any arguments.\n\nIn the signature for `area`, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`.\nThe `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`. Within an `impl` block, the\ntype `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for. Methods must\nhave a parameter named `self` of type `Self` for their first parameter, so Rust\nlets you abbreviate this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot.\nNote that we still need to use the `&` in front of the `self` shorthand to\nindicate that this method borrows the `Self` instance, just as we did in\n`rectangle: &Rectangle`. Methods can take ownership of `self`, borrow `self`\nimmutably, as we\u2019ve done here, or borrow `self` mutably, just as they can any\nother parameter.\n\nWe chose `&self` here for the same reason we used `&Rectangle` in the function\nversion: We don\u2019t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in\nthe struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we\u2019ve\ncalled the method on as part of what the method does, we\u2019d use `&mut self` as\nthe first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by\nusing just `self` as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually\nused when the method transforms `self` into something else and you want to\nprevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.\n\nThe main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to\nproviding method syntax and not having to repeat the type of `self` in every\nmethod\u2019s signature, is for organization. We\u2019ve put all the things we can do\nwith an instance of a type in one `impl` block rather than making future users\nof our code search for capabilities of `Rectangle` in various places in the\nlibrary we provide.\n\nNote that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct\u2019s\nfields. For example, we can define a method on `Rectangle` that is also named\n`width`:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-06-method-field-interaction/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we\u2019re choosing to make the `width` method return `true` if the value in\nthe instance\u2019s `width` field is greater than `0` and `false` if the value is\n`0`: We can use a field within a method of the same name for any purpose. In\n`main`, when we follow `rect1.width` with parentheses, Rust knows we mean the\nmethod `width`. When we don\u2019t use parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field\n`width`.\n\nOften, but not always, when we give a method the same name as a field we want\nit to only return the value in the field and do nothing else. Methods like this\nare called _getters_, and Rust does not implement them automatically for struct\nfields as some other languages do. Getters are useful because you can make the\nfield private but the method public and thus enable read-only access to that\nfield as part of the type\u2019s public API. We will discuss what public and private\nare and how to designate a field or method as public or private in [Chapter\n7][public]<!-- ignore -->.\n\n> ### Where\u2019s the `->` Operator?\n>\n> In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: You use\n> `.` if you\u2019re calling a method on the object directly and `->` if you\u2019re\n> calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the\n> pointer first. In other words, if `object` is a pointer,\n> `object->something()` is similar to `(*object).something()`.\n>\n> Rust doesn\u2019t have an equivalent to the `->` operator; instead, Rust has a\n> feature called _automatic referencing and dereferencing_. Calling methods is\n> one of the few places in Rust with this behavior.\n>\n> Here\u2019s how it works: When you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust\n> automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so that `object` matches the\n> signature of the method. In other words, the following are the same:\n>\n> <!-- CAN'T EXTRACT SEE BUG https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1127 -->\n>\n> ```rust\n> # #[derive(Debug,Copy,Clone)]\n> # struct Point {\n> #     x: f64,\n> #     y: f64,\n> # }\n> #\n> # impl Point {\n> #    fn distance(&self, other: &Point) -> f64 {\n> #        let x_squared = f64::powi(other.x - self.x, 2);\n> #        let y_squared = f64::powi(other.y - self.y, 2);\n> #\n> #        f64::sqrt(x_squared + y_squared)\n> #    }\n> # }\n> # let p1 = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };\n> # let p2 = Point { x: 5.0, y: 6.5 };\n> p1.distance(&p2);\n> (&p1).distance(&p2);\n> ```\n>\n> The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works\n> because methods have a clear receiver\u2014the type of `self`. Given the receiver\n> and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is\n> reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`).

    "content": "## Defining an Enum\n\nWhere structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like\na `Rectangle` with its `width` and `height`, enums give you a way of saying a\nvalue is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that\n`Rectangle` is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes `Circle` and\n`Triangle`. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums\nare useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work\nwith IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:\nversion four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an\nIP address that our program will come across, we can _enumerate_ all possible\nvariants, which is where enumeration gets its name.\n\nAny IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not\nboth at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data\nstructure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants.\nBoth version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP\naddresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling\nsituations that apply to any kind of IP address.\n\nWe can express this concept in code by defining an `IpAddrKind` enumeration and\nlisting the possible kinds an IP address can be, `V4` and `V6`. These are the\nvariants of the enum:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-01-defining-enums/src/main.rs:def}}\n```\n\n`IpAddrKind` is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.",

This is useful because now both values\n`IpAddrKind::V4` and `IpAddrKind::V6` are of the same type: `IpAddrKind`. We\ncan then, for instance, define a function that takes any `IpAddrKind`:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-01-defining-enums/src/main.rs:fn}}\n```\n\nAnd we can call this function with either variant:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-01-defining-enums/src/main.rs:fn_call}}\n```\n\nUsing enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,\nat the moment we don\u2019t have a way to store the actual IP address _data_; we\nonly know what _kind_ it is. Given that you just learned about structs in\nChapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown in\nListing 6-1.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-1\" caption=\"Storing the data and `IpAddrKind` variant of an IP address using a `struct`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-01/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we\u2019ve defined a struct `IpAddr` that has two fields: a `kind` field that\nis of type `IpAddrKind` (the enum we defined previously) and an `address` field\nof type `String`. We have two instances of this struct. The first is `home`,\nand it has the value `IpAddrKind::V4` as its `kind` with associated address\ndata of `127.0.0.1`. The second instance is `loopback`. It has the other\nvariant of `IpAddrKind` as its `kind` value, `V6`, and has address `::1`\nassociated with it. We\u2019ve used a struct to bundle the `kind` and `address`\nvalues together, so now the variant is associated with the value.\n\nHowever, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise:\nRather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into each enum\nvariant. This new definition of the `IpAddr` enum says that both `V4` and `V6`\nvariants will have associated `String` values:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-02-enum-with-data/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an\nextra struct. Here, it\u2019s also easier to see another detail of how enums work:\nThe name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that\nconstructs an instance of the enum. That is, `IpAddr::V4()` is a function call\nthat takes a `String` argument and returns an instance of the `IpAddr` type. We\nautomatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining the\nenum.\n\nThere\u2019s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: Each variant\ncan have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four IP\naddresses will always have four numeric components that will have values\nbetween 0 and 255. If we wanted to store `V4` addresses as four `u8` values but\nstill express `V6` addresses as one `String` value, we wouldn\u2019t be able to with\na struct. Enums handle this case with ease:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-03-variants-with-different-data/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe\u2019ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version\nfour and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store\nIP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that [the standard\nlibrary has a definition we can use!][IpAddr]<!-- ignore --> Let\u2019s look at how\nthe standard library defines `IpAddr`. It has the exact enum and variants that\nwe\u2019ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in\nthe form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each\nvariant:\n\n```rust\nstruct Ipv4Addr {\n    // --snip--\n}\n\nstruct Ipv6Addr {\n    // --snip--\n}\n\nenum IpAddr {\n    V4(Ipv4Addr),\n    V6(Ipv6Addr),\n}\n```\n\nThis code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant:\nstrings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another\nenum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than\nwhat you might come up with.\n\nNote that even though the standard library contains a definition for `IpAddr`,\nwe can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we\nhaven\u2019t brought the standard library\u2019s definition into our scope. We\u2019ll talk\nmore about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: This one has a wide\nvariety of types embedded in its variants.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-2\" caption=\"A `Message` enum whose variants each store different amounts and types of values\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis enum has four variants with different types:\n\n- `Quit`: Has no data associated with it at all\n- `Move`: Has named fields, like a struct does\n- `Write`: Includes a single `String`\n- `ChangeColor`: Includes three `i32` values\n\nDefining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to\ndefining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn\u2019t use the\n`struct` keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the `Message`\ntype. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum\nvariants hold:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-04-structs-similar-to-message-enum/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nBut if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we\ncouldn\u2019t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as\nwe could with the `Message` enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.\n\nThere is one more similarity between enums and structs: Just as we\u2019re able to\ndefine methods on structs using `impl`, we\u2019re also able to define methods on\nenums. Here\u2019s a method named `call` that we could define on our `Message` enum:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-05-methods-on-enums/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe body of the method would use `self` to get the value that we called the\nmethod on. In this example, we\u2019ve created a variable `m` that has the value\n`Message::Write(String::from(\"hello\"))`, and that is what `self` will be in the\nbody of the `call` method when `m.call()` runs.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and\nuseful: `Option`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "The `Option` Enum",
    "content": "This section explores a case study of `Option`, which is another enum defined\nby the standard library. The `Option` type encodes the very common scenario in\nwhich a value could be something, or it could be nothing.\n\nFor example, if you request the first item in a non-empty list, you would get\na value. If you request the first item in an empty list, you would get nothing.\nExpressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can\ncheck whether you\u2019ve handled all the cases you should be handling; this\nfunctionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming\nlanguages.\n\nProgramming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you\ninclude, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn\u2019t have the\nnull feature that many other languages have. _Null_ is a value that means there\nis no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of\ntwo states: null or not-null.\n\nIn his 2009 presentation \u201cNull References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,\u201d Tony\nHoare, the inventor of null, had this to say:\n\n> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first\n> comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My\n> goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with\n> checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn\u2019t resist the\n> temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to\n> implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system\n> crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in\n> the last forty years.\n\nThe problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a\nnot-null value, you\u2019ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null\nproperty is pervasive, it\u2019s extremely easy to make this kind of error.\n\nHowever, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: A\nnull is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t really with the concept but with the particular\nimplementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum\nthat can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is\n`Option<T>`, and it is [defined by the standard library][option]<!-- ignore -->\nas follows:\n\n```rust\nenum Option<T> {\n    None,\n    Some(T),\n}\n```\n\nThe `Option<T>` enum is so useful that it\u2019s even included in the prelude; you\ndon\u2019t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included in\nthe prelude: You can use `Some` and `None` directly without the `Option::`\nprefix. The `Option<T>` enum is still just a regular enum, and `Some(T)` and\n`None` are still variants of type `Option<T>`.\n\nThe `<T>` syntax is a feature of Rust we haven\u2019t talked about yet. It\u2019s a\ngeneric type parameter, and we\u2019ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.\nFor now, all you need to know is that `<T>` means that the `Some` variant of\nthe `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each\nconcrete type that gets used in place of `T` makes the overall `Option<T>` type\na different type. Here are some examples of using `Option` values to hold\nnumber types and char types:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-06-option-examples/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe type of `some_number` is `Option<i32>`. The type of `some_char` is\n`Option<char>`, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because\nwe\u2019ve specified a value inside the `Some` variant. For `absent_number`, Rust\nrequires us to annotate the overall `Option` type: The compiler can\u2019t infer the\ntype that the corresponding `Some` variant will hold by looking only at a\n`None` value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for `absent_number` to be of type\n`Option<i32>`.\n\nWhen we have a `Some` value, we know that a value is present, and the value is\nheld within the `Some`. When we have a `None` value, in some sense it means the\nsame thing as null: We don\u2019t have a valid value. So, why is having `Option<T>`\nany better than having null?\n\nIn short, because `Option<T>` and `T` (where `T` can be any type) are different\ntypes, the compiler won\u2019t let us use an `Option<T>` value as if it were\ndefinitely a valid value. For example, this code won\u2019t compile, because it\u2019s\ntrying to add an `i8` to an `Option<i8>`:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-07-cant-use-option-directly/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nIf we run this code, we get an error message like this one:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-07-cant-use-option-directly/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIntense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn\u2019t understand how\nto add an `i8` and an `Option<i8>`, because they\u2019re different types. When we\nhave a value of a type like `i8` in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we\nalways have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check\nfor null before using that value. Only when we have an `Option<i8>` (or\nwhatever type of value we\u2019re working with) do we have to worry about possibly\nnot having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before\nusing the value.\n\nIn other words, you have to convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can\nperform `T` operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most\ncommon issues with null: assuming that something isn\u2019t null when it actually is.\n\nEliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you be more\nconfident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be null, you\nmust explicitly opt in by making the type of that value `Option<T>`. Then, when\nyou use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case when the\nvalue is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn\u2019t an `Option<T>`,\nyou _can_ safely assume that the value isn\u2019t null. This was a deliberate design\ndecision for Rust to limit null\u2019s pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust\ncode.\n\nSo how do you get the `T` value out of a `Some` variant when you have a value\nof type `Option<T>` so that you can use that value? The `Option<T>` enum has a\nlarge number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can\ncheck them out in [its documentation][docs]<!-- ignore -->. Becoming familiar\nwith the methods on `Option<T>` will be extremely useful in your journey with\nRust.\n\nIn general, in order to use an `Option<T>` value, you want to have code that\nwill handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have a\n`Some(T)` value, and this code is allowed to use the inner `T`. You want some\nother code to run only if you have a `None` value, and that code doesn\u2019t have a\n`T` value available. The `match` expression is a control flow construct that\ndoes just this when used with enums: It will run different code depending on\nwhich variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the\nmatching value.\n\n[IpAddr]: ../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html\n[option]: ../std/option/enum.Option.html\n[docs]: ../std/option/enum.Option.html",

Patterns can be made up of literal values,\nvariable names, wildcards, and many other things; [Chapter\n19][ch19-00-patterns]<!-- ignore --> covers all the different kinds of patterns\nand what they do. The power of `match` comes from the expressiveness of the\npatterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are\nhandled.\n\nThink of a `match` expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: Coins slide\ndown a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through\nthe first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go\nthrough each pattern in a `match`, and at the first pattern the value \u201cfits,\u201d\nthe value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.\n\nSpeaking of coins, let\u2019s use them as an example using `match`! We can write a\nfunction that takes an unknown US coin and, in a similar way as the counting\nmachine, determines which coin it is and returns its value in cents, as shown\nin Listing 6-3.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-3\" caption=\"An enum and a `match` expression that has the variants of the enum as its patterns\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s break down the `match` in the `value_in_cents` function. First, we list\nthe `match` keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value\n`coin`. This seems very similar to a conditional expression used with `if`, but\nthere\u2019s a big difference: With `if`, the condition needs to evaluate to a\nBoolean value, but here it can be any type. The type of `coin` in this example\nis the `Coin` enum that we defined on the first line.\n\nNext are the `match` arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The\nfirst arm here has a pattern that is the value `Coin::Penny` and then the `=>`\noperator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case\nis just the value `1`. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.\n\nWhen the `match` expression executes, it compares the resultant value against\nthe pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code\nassociated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn\u2019t match the\nvalue, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.\nWe can have as many arms as we need: In Listing 6-3, our `match` has four arms.\n\nThe code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of\nthe expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the\nentire `match` expression.\n\nWe don\u2019t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is\nin Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple\nlines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma\nfollowing the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints\n\u201cLucky penny!\u201d every time the method is called with a `Coin::Penny`, but it\nstill returns the last value of the block, `1`:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-08-match-arm-multiple-lines/src/main.rs:here}}\n```",

    "content": "Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the\nvalues that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum\nvariants.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.\nFrom 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different\ndesigns for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state\ndesigns, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to\nour `enum` by changing the `Quarter` variant to include a `UsState` value\nstored inside it, which we\u2019ve done in Listing 6-4.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-4\" caption=\"A `Coin` enum in which the `Quarter` variant also holds a `UsState` value\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While\nwe sort our loose change by coin type, we\u2019ll also call out the name of the\nstate associated with each quarter so that if it\u2019s one our friend doesn\u2019t have,\nthey can add it to their collection.\n\nIn the match expression for this code, we add a variable called `state` to the\npattern that matches values of the variant `Coin::Quarter`. When a\n`Coin::Quarter` matches, the `state` variable will bind to the value of that\nquarter\u2019s state. Then, we can use `state` in the code for that arm, like so:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-09-variable-in-pattern/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nIf we were to call `value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))`, `coin`\nwould be `Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)`. When we compare that value with each\nof the match arms, none of them match until we reach `Coin::Quarter(state)`. At\nthat point, the binding for `state` will be the value `UsState::Alaska`. We can\nthen use that binding in the `println!` expression, thus getting the inner\nstate value out of the `Coin` enum variant for `Quarter`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

If there isn\u2019t a value inside,\nthe function should return the `None` value and not attempt to perform any\noperations.\n\nThis function is very easy to write, thanks to `match`, and will look like\nListing 6-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-5\" caption=\"A function that uses a `match` expression on an `Option<i32>`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-05/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s examine the first execution of `plus_one` in more detail. When we call\n`plus_one(five)`, the variable `x` in the body of `plus_one` will have the\nvalue `Some(5)`.

It does! We have the same variant. The `i`\nbinds to the value contained in `Some`, so `i` takes the value `5`. The code in\nthe match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of `i` and create a\nnew `Some` value with our total `6` inside.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the second call of `plus_one` in Listing 6-5, where `x` is\n`None`. We enter the `match` and compare to the first arm:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-05/src/main.rs:first_arm}}\n```\n\nIt matches! There\u2019s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the\n`None` value on the right side of `=>`. Because the first arm matched, no other\narms are compared.\n\nCombining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You\u2019ll see this\npattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the\ndata inside, and then execute code based on it. It\u2019s a bit tricky at first, but\nonce you get used to it, you\u2019ll wish you had it in all languages. It\u2019s\nconsistently a user favorite.",

Imagine we\u2019re implementing a game\nwhere, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn\u2019t move but instead\ngets a fancy new hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all\nother values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here\u2019s\na `match` that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll\nhardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by\nfunctions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for\nthis example:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-15-binding-catchall/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nFor the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values `3` and `7`.

The code that runs for the `other` arm\nuses the variable by passing it to the `move_player` function.\n\nThis code compiles, even though we haven\u2019t listed all the possible values a\n`u8` can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically\nlisted. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that `match` must be\nexhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the\npatterns are evaluated in order. If we had put the catch-all arm earlier, the\nother arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a\ncatch-all!\n\nRust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don\u2019t want to\n_use_ the value in the catch-all pattern: `_` is a special pattern that matches\nany value and does not bind to that value.

    "content": "## Concise Control Flow with `if let` and `let...else`\n\nThe `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to\nhandle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the\nprogram in Listing 6-6 that matches on an `Option<u8>` value in the\n`config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the `Some`\nvariant.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-6\" caption=\"A `match` that only cares about executing code when the value is `Some`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf the value is `Some`, we print out the value in the `Some` variant by binding\nthe value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We don\u2019t want to do anything\nwith the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we have to add `_ =>\n()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to\nadd.\n\nInstead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following\ncode behaves the same as the `match` in Listing 6-6:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-12-if-let/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal\nsign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the\n`match` and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is\n`Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Some`. We can then\nuse `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way we used `max` in\nthe corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block only runs if the\nvalue matches the pattern.\n\nUsing `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.\nHowever, you lose the exhaustive checking `match` enforces that ensures that\nyou aren\u2019t forgetting to handle any cases. Choosing between `match` and `if\nlet` depends on what you\u2019re doing in your particular situation and whether\ngaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.\n\nIn other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that\nruns code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.\n\nWe can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with the\n`else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the\n`match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`. Recall the\n`Coin` enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the `Quarter` variant also held a\n`UsState` value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also\nannouncing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a `match`\nexpression, like this:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-13-count-and-announce-match/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nOr we could use an `if let` and `else` expression, like this:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-14-count-and-announce-if-let-else/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n## Staying on the \u201cHappy Path\u201d with `let...else`\n\nThe common pattern is to perform some computation when a value is present and\nreturn a default value otherwise. Continuing with our example of coins with a\n`UsState` value, if we wanted to say something funny depending on how old the\nstate on the quarter was, we might introduce a method on `UsState` to check the\nage of a state, like so:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-07/src/main.rs:state}}\n```\n\nThen, we might use `if let` to match on the type of coin, introducing a `state`\nvariable within the body of the condition, as in Listing 6-7.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-7\" caption=\"Checking whether a state existed in 1900 by using conditionals nested inside an `if let`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-07/src/main.rs:describe}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThat gets the job done, but it has pushed the work into the body of the `if\nlet` statement, and if the work to be done is more complicated, it might be\nhard to follow exactly how the top-level branches relate. We could also take\nadvantage of the fact that expressions produce a value either to produce the\n`state` from the `if let` or to return early, as in Listing 6-8. (You could do\nsomething similar with a `match`, too.)\n\n<Listing number=\"6-8\" caption=\"Using `if let` to produce a value or return early\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-08/src/main.rs:describe}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis is a bit annoying to follow in its own way, though! One branch of the `if\nlet` produces a value, and the other one returns from the function entirely.\n\nTo make this common pattern nicer to express, Rust has `let...else`. The\n`let...else` syntax takes a pattern on the left side and an expression on the\nright, very similar to `if let`, but it does not have an `if` branch, only an\n`else` branch. If the pattern matches, it will bind the value from the pattern\nin the outer scope. If the pattern does _not_ match, the program will flow into\nthe `else` arm, which must return from the function.\n\nIn Listing 6-9, you can see how Listing 6-8 looks when using `let...else` in\nplace of `if let`.\n\n<Listing number=\"6-9\" caption=\"Using `let...else` to clarify the flow through the function\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-09/src/main.rs:describe}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNotice that it stays on the \u201chappy path\u201d in the main body of the function this\nway, without having significantly different control flow for two branches the\nway the `if let` did.\n\nIf you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to\nexpress using a `match`, remember that `if let` and `let...else` are in your\nRust toolbox as well.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe\u2019ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a\nset of enumerated values. We\u2019ve shown how the standard library\u2019s `Option<T>`\ntype helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have\ndata inside them, you can use `match` or `if let` to extract and use those\nvalues, depending on how many cases you need to handle.\n\nYour Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and\nenums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: The\ncompiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each\nfunction expects.\n\nIn order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward\nto use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let\u2019s now turn to\nRust\u2019s modules.",

By grouping related functionality and separating code with distinct\nfeatures, you\u2019ll clarify where to find code that implements a particular\nfeature and where to go to change how a feature works.\n\nThe programs we\u2019ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a\nproject grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules\nand then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and\noptionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into\nseparate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all\nthese techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated\npackages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces, which we\u2019ll cover in\n[\u201cCargo Workspaces\u201d][workspaces]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 14.\n\nWe\u2019ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse\ncode at a higher level: Once you\u2019ve implemented an operation, other code can\ncall your code via its public interface without having to know how the\nimplementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public for\nother code to use and which parts are private implementation details that you\nreserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of detail\nyou have to keep in your head.\n\nA related concept is scope: The nested context in which code is written has a\nset of names that are defined as \u201cin scope.\u201d When reading, writing, and\ncompiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular\nname at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module,\nconstant, or other item and what that item means. You can create scopes and\nchange which names are in or out of scope. You can\u2019t have two items with the\nsame name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.\n\nRust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code\u2019s\norganization, including which details are exposed, which details are private,\nand what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes\ncollectively referred to as the _module system_, include:\n\n* **Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates\n* **Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable\n* **Modules and use**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of\npaths\n* **Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll cover all these features, discuss how they interact, and\nexplain how to use them to manage scope. By the end, you should have a solid\nunderstanding of the module system and be able to work with scopes like a pro!\n\n[workspaces]: ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html",

    "content": "## Packages and Crates\n\nThe first parts of the module system we\u2019ll cover are packages and crates.\n\nA _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a\ntime. Even if you run `rustc` rather than `cargo` and pass a single source code\nfile (as we did all the way back in [\u201cRust Program Basics\u201d][basics]<!-- ignore\n--> in Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates can\ncontain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get\ncompiled with the crate, as we\u2019ll see in the coming sections.\n\nA crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.\n_Binary crates_ are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run,\nsuch as a command line program or a server. Each must have a function called\n`main` that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we\u2019ve\ncreated so far have been binary crates.\n\n_Library crates_ don\u2019t have a `main` function, and they don\u2019t compile to an\nexecutable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with\nmultiple projects. For example, the `rand` crate we used in [Chapter\n2][rand]<!-- ignore --> provides functionality that generates random numbers.\nMost of the time when Rustaceans say \u201ccrate,\u201d they mean library crate, and they\nuse \u201ccrate\u201d interchangeably with the general programming concept of a \u201clibrary.\u201d\n\nThe _crate root_ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes\nup the root module of your crate (we\u2019ll explain modules in depth in [\u201cControl\nScope and Privacy with Modules\u201d][modules]<!-- ignore -->).\n\nA _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of\nfunctionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to\nbuild those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary crate\nfor the command line tool you\u2019ve been using to build your code. The Cargo\npackage also contains a library crate that the binary crate depends on. Other\nprojects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same logic the Cargo\ncommand line tool uses.\n\nA package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one\nlibrary crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that\u2019s a\nlibrary or binary crate.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the\ncommand `cargo new my-project`:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new my-project\n     Created binary (application) `my-project` package\n$ ls my-project\nCargo.toml\nsrc\n$ ls my-project/src\nmain.rs\n```\n\nAfter we run `cargo new my-project`, we use `ls` to see what Cargo creates. In\nthe _my-project_ directory, there\u2019s a _Cargo.toml_ file, giving us a package.\nThere\u2019s also a _src_ directory that contains _main.rs_. Open _Cargo.toml_ in\nyour text editor and note that there\u2019s no mention of _src/main.rs_. Cargo\nfollows a convention that _src/main.rs_ is the crate root of a binary crate\nwith the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package\ndirectory contains _src/lib.rs_, the package contains a library crate with the\nsame name as the package, and _src/lib.rs_ is its crate root. Cargo passes the\ncrate root files to `rustc` to build the library or binary.\n\nHere, we have a package that only contains _src/main.rs_, meaning it only\ncontains a binary crate named `my-project`. If a package contains _src/main.rs_\nand _src/lib.rs_, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same\nname as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files\nin the _src/bin_ directory: Each file will be a separate binary crate.\n\n[basics]: ch01-02-hello-world.html#rust-program-basics\n[modules]: ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html\n[rand]: ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number",

    "content": "Before we get to the details of modules and paths, here we provide a quick\nreference on how modules, paths, the `use` keyword, and the `pub` keyword work\nin the compiler, and how most developers organize their code. We\u2019ll be going\nthrough examples of each of these rules throughout this chapter, but this is a\ngreat place to refer to as a reminder of how modules work.\n\n- **Start from the crate root**: When compiling a crate, the compiler first\n  looks in the crate root file (usually _src/lib.rs_ for a library crate and\n  _src/main.rs_ for a binary crate) for code to compile.\n- **Declaring modules**: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules;\n  say you declare a \u201cgarden\u201d module with `mod garden;`. The compiler will look\n  for the module\u2019s code in these places:\n  - Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod\n    garden`\n  - In the file _src/garden.rs_\n  - In the file _src/garden/mod.rs_\n- **Declaring submodules**: In any file other than the crate root, you can\n  declare submodules. For example, you might declare `mod vegetables;` in\n  _src/garden.rs_. The compiler will look for the submodule\u2019s code within the\n  directory named for the parent module in these places:\n  - Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets instead\n    of the semicolon\n  - In the file _src/garden/vegetables.rs_\n  - In the file _src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs_\n- **Paths to code in modules**: Once a module is part of your crate, you can\n  refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long\n  as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an\n  `Asparagus` type in the garden vegetables module would be found at\n  `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`.\n- **Private vs. public**: Code within a module is private from its parent\n  modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with `pub mod`\n  instead of `mod`. To make items within a public module public as well, use\n  `pub` before their declarations.\n- **The `use` keyword**: Within a scope, the `use` keyword creates shortcuts to\n  items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to\n  `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`, you can create a shortcut with `use\n  crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;`, and from then on you only need to\n  write `Asparagus` to make use of that type in the scope.\n\nHere, we create a binary crate named `backyard` that illustrates these rules.\nThe crate\u2019s directory, also named _backyard_, contains these files and\ndirectories:\n\n```text\nbackyard\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 garden\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 vegetables.rs\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 garden.rs\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.rs\n```\n\nThe crate root file in this case is _src/main.rs_, and it contains:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `pub mod garden;` line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in\n_src/garden.rs_, which is:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/garden.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/garden.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, `pub mod vegetables;` means the code in _src/garden/vegetables.rs_ is\nincluded too. That code is:\n\n```rust,noplayground,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/garden/vegetables.rs}}\n```\n\nNow let\u2019s get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!",

    "content": "_Modules_ let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.\nModules also allow us to control the _privacy_ of items because code within a\nmodule is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details\nnot available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items\nwithin them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend\non them.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s write a library crate that provides the functionality of a\nrestaurant. We\u2019ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies\nempty to concentrate on the organization of the code rather than the\nimplementation of a restaurant.\n\nIn the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as front\nof house and others as back of house. _Front of house_ is where customers are;\nthis encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take orders and\npayment, and bartenders make drinks. _Back of house_ is where the chefs and\ncooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do administrative\nwork.\n\nTo structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested\nmodules. Create a new library named `restaurant` by running `cargo new\nrestaurant --lib`. Then, enter the code in Listing 7-1 into _src/lib.rs_ to\ndefine some modules and function signatures; this code is the front of house\nsection.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-1\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `front_of_house` module containing other modules that then contain functions\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-01/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe define a module with the `mod` keyword followed by the name of the module\n(in this case, `front_of_house`). The body of the module then goes inside curly\nbrackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the\nmodules `hosting` and `serving`. Modules can also hold definitions for other\nitems, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and as in Listing 7-1,\nfunctions.\n\nBy using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why\nthey\u2019re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on the\ngroups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier\nto find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality\nto this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.\n\nEarlier, we mentioned that _src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ are called _crate\nroots_. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two\nfiles form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate\u2019s module structure,\nknown as the _module tree_.\n\nListing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-2\" caption=\"The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1\">\n\n```text\ncrate\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 front_of_house\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 hosting\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 add_to_waitlist\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 seat_at_table\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 serving\n         \u251c\u2500\u2500 take_order\n         \u251c\u2500\u2500 serve_order\n         \u2514\u2500\u2500 take_payment\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis tree shows how some of the modules nest inside other modules; for example,\n`hosting` nests inside `front_of_house`. The tree also shows that some modules\nare _siblings_, meaning they\u2019re defined in the same module; `hosting` and\n`serving` are siblings defined within `front_of_house`. If module A is\ncontained inside module B, we say that module A is the _child_ of module B and\nthat module B is the _parent_ of module A. Notice that the entire module tree\nis rooted under the implicit module named `crate`.\n\nThe module tree might remind you of the filesystem\u2019s directory tree on your\ncomputer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem,\nyou use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we\nneed a way to find our modules.",

    "content": "## Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree\n\nTo show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same\nway we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to\nknow its path.\n\nA path can take two forms:\n\n- An _absolute path_ is the full path starting from a crate root; for code\n  from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for\n  code from the current crate, it starts with the literal `crate`.\n- A _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or\n  an identifier in the current module.\n\nBoth absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers\nseparated by double colons (`::`).\n\nReturning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the `add_to_waitlist` function.\nThis is the same as asking: What\u2019s the path of the `add_to_waitlist` function?\nListing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions removed.\n\nWe\u2019ll show two ways to call the `add_to_waitlist` function from a new function,\n`eat_at_restaurant`, defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but\nthere\u2019s another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling\nas is. We\u2019ll explain why in a bit.\n\nThe `eat_at_restaurant` function is part of our library crate\u2019s public API, so\nwe mark it with the `pub` keyword. In the [\u201cExposing Paths with the `pub`\nKeyword\u201d][pub]<!-- ignore --> section, we\u2019ll go into more detail about `pub`.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-3\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Calling the `add_to_waitlist` function using absolute and relative paths\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-03/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe first time we call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`,\nwe use an absolute path. The `add_to_waitlist` function is defined in the same\ncrate as `eat_at_restaurant`, which means we can use the `crate` keyword to\nstart an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we\nmake our way to `add_to_waitlist`. You can imagine a filesystem with the same\nstructure: We\u2019d specify the path `/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist` to\nrun the `add_to_waitlist` program; using the `crate` name to start from the\ncrate root is like using `/` to start from the filesystem root in your shell.\n\nThe second time we call `add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use a\nrelative path. The path starts with `front_of_house`, the name of the module\ndefined at the same level of the module tree as `eat_at_restaurant`. Here the\nfilesystem equivalent would be using the path\n`front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist`. Starting with a module name means\nthat the path is relative.\n\nChoosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you\u2019ll make\nbased on your project, and it depends on whether you\u2019re more likely to move\nitem definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the\nitem. For example, if we moved the `front_of_house` module and the\n`eat_at_restaurant` function into a module named `customer_experience`, we\u2019d\nneed to update the absolute path to `add_to_waitlist`, but the relative path\nwould still be valid. However, if we moved the `eat_at_restaurant` function\nseparately into a module named `dining`, the absolute path to the\n`add_to_waitlist` call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to\nbe updated. Our preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it\u2019s\nmore likely we\u2019ll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of\neach other.\n\nLet\u2019s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won\u2019t compile yet! The\nerrors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-4\" caption=\"Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3\">\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-03/output.txt}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe error messages say that module `hosting` is private. In other words, we\nhave the correct paths for the `hosting` module and the `add_to_waitlist`\nfunction, but Rust won\u2019t let us use them because it doesn\u2019t have access to the\nprivate sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums,\nmodules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want\nto make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.\n\nItems in a parent module can\u2019t use the private items inside child modules, but\nitems in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is\nbecause child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child\nmodules can see the context in which they\u2019re defined. To continue with our\nmetaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a\nrestaurant: What goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but\noffice managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.\n\nRust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner\nimplementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the\ninner code you can change without breaking the outer code. However, Rust does\ngive you the option to expose inner parts of child modules\u2019 code to outer\nancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.",

We want the `eat_at_restaurant` function in the parent module to have\naccess to the `add_to_waitlist` function in the child module, so we mark the\n`hosting` module with the `pub` keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-5\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Declaring the `hosting` module as `pub` to use it from `eat_at_restaurant`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-05/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nUnfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in compiler errors, as\nshown in Listing 7-6.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-6\" caption=\"Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-5\">\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-05/output.txt}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhat happened? Adding the `pub` keyword in front of `mod hosting` makes the\nmodule public. With this change, if we can access `front_of_house`, we can\naccess `hosting`. But the _contents_ of `hosting` are still private; making the\nmodule public doesn\u2019t make its contents public. The `pub` keyword on a module\nonly lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.\nBecause modules are containers, there\u2019s not much we can do by only making the\nmodule public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the\nitems within the module public as well.\n\nThe errors in Listing 7-6 say that the `add_to_waitlist` function is private.\nThe privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as\nmodules.\n\nLet\u2019s also make the `add_to_waitlist` function public by adding the `pub`\nkeyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-7\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding the `pub` keyword to `mod hosting` and `fn add_to_waitlist` lets us call the function from `eat_at_restaurant`.\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,test_harness\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-07/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNow the code will compile! To see why adding the `pub` keyword lets us use\nthese paths in `eat_at_restaurant` with respect to the privacy rules, let\u2019s\nlook at the absolute and the relative paths.\n\nIn the absolute path, we start with `crate`, the root of our crate\u2019s module\ntree. The `front_of_house` module is defined in the crate root. While\n`front_of_house` isn\u2019t public, because the `eat_at_restaurant` function is\ndefined in the same module as `front_of_house` (that is, `eat_at_restaurant`\nand `front_of_house` are siblings), we can refer to `front_of_house` from\n`eat_at_restaurant`. Next is the `hosting` module marked with `pub`. We can\naccess the parent module of `hosting`, so we can access `hosting`. Finally, the\n`add_to_waitlist` function is marked with `pub`, and we can access its parent\nmodule, so this function call works!\n\nIn the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the\nfirst step: Rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from\n`front_of_house`. The `front_of_house` module is defined within the same module\nas `eat_at_restaurant`, so the relative path starting from the module in which\n`eat_at_restaurant` is defined works. Then, because `hosting` and\n`add_to_waitlist` are marked with `pub`, the rest of the path works, and this\nfunction call is valid!\n\nIf you plan to share your library crate so that other projects can use your\ncode, your public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines\nhow they can interact with your code. There are many considerations around\nmanaging changes to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on\nyour crate. These considerations are beyond the scope of this book; if you\u2019re\ninterested in this topic, see [the Rust API Guidelines][api-guidelines].\n\n> #### Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library\n>\n> We mentioned that a package can contain both a _src/main.rs_ binary crate\n> root as well as a _src/lib.rs_ library crate root, and both crates will have\n> the package name by default.

In Listing 7-9, we\u2019ve defined a public `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct\nwith a public `toast` field but a private `seasonal_fruit` field. This models\nthe case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that\ncomes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based\non what\u2019s in season and in stock.

Try uncommenting the\nline modifying the `seasonal_fruit` field value to see what error you get!\n\nAlso, note that because `back_of_house::Breakfast` has a private field, the\nstruct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an\ninstance of `Breakfast` (we\u2019ve named it `summer` here). If `Breakfast` didn\u2019t\nhave such a function, we couldn\u2019t create an instance of `Breakfast` in\n`eat_at_restaurant`, because we couldn\u2019t set the value of the private\n`seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant`.\n\nIn contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public.

In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to\nthe `add_to_waitlist` function, every time we wanted to call `add_to_waitlist`\nwe had to specify `front_of_house` and `hosting` too. Fortunately, there\u2019s a\nway to simplify this process: We can create a shortcut to a path with the `use`\nkeyword once and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.\n\nIn Listing 7-11, we bring the `crate::front_of_house::hosting` module into the\nscope of the `eat_at_restaurant` function so that we only have to specify\n`hosting::add_to_waitlist` to call the `add_to_waitlist` function in\n`eat_at_restaurant`.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-11\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Bringing a module into scope with `use`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,test_harness\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-11/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAdding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in\nthe filesystem. By adding `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` in the crate\nroot, `hosting` is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the `hosting`\nmodule had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope with `use`\nalso check privacy, like any other paths.\n\nNote that `use` only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the\n`use` occurs. Listing 7-12 moves the `eat_at_restaurant` function into a new\nchild module named `customer`, which is then a different scope than the `use`\nstatement, so the function body won\u2019t compile.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-12\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `use` statement only applies in the scope it\u2019s in.\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,test_harness,does_not_compile,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-12/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe compiler error shows that the shortcut no longer applies within the\n`customer` module:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-12/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNotice there\u2019s also a warning that the `use` is no longer used in its scope!

Bringing\nthe function\u2019s parent module into scope with `use` means we have to specify the\nparent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when\ncalling the function makes it clear that the function isn\u2019t locally defined\nwhile still minimizing repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13 is\nunclear as to where `add_to_waitlist` is defined.\n\nOn the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with `use`,\nit\u2019s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows the idiomatic way\nto bring the standard library\u2019s `HashMap` struct into the scope of a binary\ncrate.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-14\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Bringing `HashMap` into scope in an idiomatic way\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-14/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThere\u2019s no strong reason behind this idiom: It\u2019s just the convention that has\nemerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.\n\nThe exception to this idiom is if we\u2019re bringing two items with the same name\ninto scope with `use` statements, because Rust doesn\u2019t allow that.

    "content": "## Separating Modules into Different Files\n\nSo far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file.\nWhen modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate\nfile to make the code easier to navigate.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple\nrestaurant modules. We\u2019ll extract modules into files instead of having all the\nmodules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file is\n_src/lib.rs_, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root\nfile is _src/main.rs_.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll extract the `front_of_house` module to its own file. Remove the\ncode inside the curly brackets for the `front_of_house` module, leaving only\nthe `mod front_of_house;` declaration, so that _src/lib.rs_ contains the code\nshown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won\u2019t compile until we create the\n_src/front_of_house.rs_ file in Listing 7-22.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-21\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Declaring the `front_of_house` module whose body will be in *src/front_of_house.rs*\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-21-and-22/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNext, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file named\n_src/front_of_house.rs_, as shown in Listing 7-22. The compiler knows to look\nin this file because it came across the module declaration in the crate root\nwith the name `front_of_house`.\n\n<Listing number=\"7-22\" file-name=\"src/front_of_house.rs\" caption=\"Definitions inside the `front_of_house` module in *src/front_of_house.rs*\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-21-and-22/src/front_of_house.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that you only need to load a file using a `mod` declaration _once_ in your\nmodule tree. Once the compiler knows the file is part of the project (and knows\nwhere in the module tree the code resides because of where you\u2019ve put the `mod`\nstatement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded file\u2019s code\nusing a path to where it was declared, as covered in the [\u201cPaths for Referring\nto an Item in the Module Tree\u201d][paths]<!-- ignore --> section. In other words,\n`mod` is _not_ an \u201cinclude\u201d operation that you may have seen in other\nprogramming languages.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll extract the `hosting` module to its own file. The process is a bit\ndifferent because `hosting` is a child module of `front_of_house`, not of the\nroot module. We\u2019ll place the file for `hosting` in a new directory that will be\nnamed for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case _src/front_of_house_.\n\nTo start moving `hosting`, we change _src/front_of_house.rs_ to contain only\nthe declaration of the `hosting` module:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/front_of_house.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/no-listing-02-extracting-hosting/src/front_of_house.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThen, we create a _src/front_of_house_ directory and a _hosting.rs_ file to\ncontain the definitions made in the `hosting` module:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/front_of_house/hosting.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/no-listing-02-extracting-hosting/src/front_of_house/hosting.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf we instead put _hosting.rs_ in the _src_ directory, the compiler would\nexpect the _hosting.rs_ code to be in a `hosting` module declared in the crate\nroot and not declared as a child of the `front_of_house` module. The\ncompiler\u2019s rules for which files to check for which modules\u2019 code mean the\ndirectories and files more closely match the module tree.\n\n> ### Alternate File Paths\n>\n> So far we\u2019ve covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses,\n> but Rust also supports an older style of file path. For a module named\n> `front_of_house` declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the\n> module\u2019s code in:\n>\n> - _src/front_of_house.rs_ (what we covered)\n> - _src/front_of_house/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)\n>\n> For a module named `hosting` that is a submodule of `front_of_house`, the\n> compiler will look for the module\u2019s code in:\n>\n> - _src/front_of_house/hosting.rs_ (what we covered)\n> - _src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)\n>\n> If you use both styles for the same module, you\u2019ll get a compiler error.\n> Using a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is\n> allowed but might be confusing for people navigating your project.\n>\n> The main downside to the style that uses files named _mod.rs_ is that your\n> project can end up with many files named _mod.rs_, which can get confusing\n> when you have them open in your editor at the same time.\n\nWe\u2019ve moved each module\u2019s code to a separate file, and the module tree remains\nthe same. The function calls in `eat_at_restaurant` will work without any\nmodification, even though the definitions live in different files. This\ntechnique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.\n\nNote that the `pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting` statement in\n_src/lib.rs_ also hasn\u2019t changed, nor does `use` have any impact on what files\nare compiled as part of the crate. The `mod` keyword declares modules, and Rust\nlooks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into\nthat module.\n\n## Summary\n\nRust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules so\nthat you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. You can\ndo this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought\ninto scope with a `use` statement so that you can use a shorter path for\nmultiple uses of the item in that scope. Module code is private by default, but\nyou can make definitions public by adding the `pub` keyword.\n\nIn the next chapter, we\u2019ll look at some collection data structures in the\nstandard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.\n\n[paths]: ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html",

Most other data types represent one specific value, but\ncollections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple\ntypes, the data that these collections point to is stored on the heap, which\nmeans the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow\nor shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different\ncapabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current\nsituation is a skill you\u2019ll develop over time. In this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss\nthree collections that are used very often in Rust programs:\n\n- A _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.\n- A _string_ is a collection of characters. We\u2019ve mentioned the `String` type\n  previously, but in this chapter, we\u2019ll talk about it in depth.\n- A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a specific key. It\u2019s a\n  particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.\n\nTo learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library,\nsee [the documentation][collections].\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well\nas what makes each special.\n\n[collections]: ../std/collections/index.html",

Because we aren\u2019t inserting any\nvalues into this vector, Rust doesn\u2019t know what kind of elements we intend to\nstore. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics;\nwe\u2019ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now,\nknow that the `Vec<T>` type provided by the standard library can hold any type.\nWhen we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can specify the type within\nangle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we\u2019ve told Rust that the `Vec<T>` in `v` will\nhold elements of the `i32` type.\n\nMore often, you\u2019ll create a `Vec<T>` with initial values, and Rust will infer\nthe type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type\nannotation. Rust conveniently provides the `vec!` macro, which will create a\nnew vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new\n`Vec<i32>` that holds the values `1`, `2`, and `3`.

    "content": "There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or by\nusing the `get` method. In the following examples, we\u2019ve annotated the types of\nthe values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.\n\nListing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with indexing\nsyntax and the `get` method.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-4\" caption=\"Using indexing syntax and using the `get` method to access an item in a vector\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote a few details here. We use the index value of `2` to get the third element\nbecause vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Using `&` and `[]`\ngives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use the `get`\nmethod with the index passed as an argument, we get an `Option<&T>` that we can\nuse with `match`.\n\nRust provides these two ways to reference an element so that you can choose how\nthe program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the range of\nexisting elements. As an example, let\u2019s see what happens when we have a vector\nof five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100 with each\ntechnique, as shown in Listing 8-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-5\" caption=\"Attempting to access the element at index 100 in a vector containing five elements\">\n\n```rust,should_panic,panics\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-05/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we run this code, the first `[]` method will cause the program to panic\nbecause it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you\nwant your program to crash if there\u2019s an attempt to access an element past the\nend of the vector.\n\nWhen the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns\n`None` without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an element\nbeyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal\ncircumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either\n`Some(&element)` or `None`, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the index\ncould be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a\nnumber that\u2019s too large and the program gets a `None` value, you could tell the\nuser how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to\nenter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program\ndue to a typo!\n\nWhen the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the\nownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure that this\nreference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid.\nRecall the rule that states you can\u2019t have mutable and immutable references in\nthe same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable\nreference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the\nend. This program won\u2019t work if we also try to refer to that element later in\nthe function.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-6\" caption=\"Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nCompiling this code will result in this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-06/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: Why should a reference\nto the first element care about changes at the end of the vector? This error is\ndue to the way vectors work: Because vectors put the values next to each other\nin memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require\nallocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there\nisn\u2019t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector\nis currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be\npointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from\nending up in that situation.\n\n> Note: For more on the implementation details of the `Vec<T>` type, see [\u201cThe\n> Rustonomicon\u201d][nomicon].",

Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined\nunder the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of\ndifferent types, we can define and use an enum!\n\nFor example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which\nsome of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers,\nand some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different\nvalue types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that\nof the enum. Then, we can create a vector to hold that enum and so, ultimately,\nhold different types.

These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you\u2019re\ncoming from other programming languages.\n\nWe discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are\nimplemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful\nfunctionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we\u2019ll\ntalk about the operations on `String` that every collection type has, such as\ncreating, updating, and reading.

The reason `s1` is no longer\nvalid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to `s2`, has to do\nwith the signature of the method that\u2019s called when we use the `+` operator.\nThe `+` operator uses the `add` method, whose signature looks something like\nthis:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn add(self, s: &str) -> String {\n```\n\nIn the standard library, you\u2019ll see `add` defined using generics and associated\ntypes. Here, we\u2019ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we\ncall this method with `String` values. We\u2019ll discuss generics in Chapter 10.\nThis signature gives us the clues we need in order to understand the tricky\nbits of the `+` operator.\n\nFirst, `s2` has an `&`, meaning that we\u2019re adding a reference of the second\nstring to the first string. This is because of the `s` parameter in the `add`\nfunction: We can only add a string slice to a `String`; we can\u2019t add two\n`String` values together. But wait\u2014the type of `&s2` is `&String`, not `&str`,\nas specified in the second parameter to `add`. So, why does Listing 8-18\ncompile?\n\nThe reason we\u2019re able to use `&s2` in the call to `add` is that the compiler\ncan coerce the `&String` argument into a `&str`. When we call the `add` method,\nRust uses a deref coercion, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]`. We\u2019ll\ndiscuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because `add` does not take\nownership of the `s` parameter, `s2` will still be a valid `String` after this\noperation.\n\nSecond, we can see in the signature that `add` takes ownership of `self`\nbecause `self` does _not_ have an `&`. This means `s1` in Listing 8-18 will be\nmoved into the `add` call and will no longer be valid after that. So, although\n`let s3 = s1 + &s2;` looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one,\nthis statement actually takes ownership of `s1`, appends a copy of the contents\nof `s2`, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks\nlike it\u2019s making a lot of copies, but it isn\u2019t; the implementation is more\nefficient than copying.\n\nIf we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the `+` operator\ngets unwieldy:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/no-listing-01-concat-multiple-strings/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nAt this point, `s` will be `tic-tac-toe`. With all of the `+` and `\"`\ncharacters, it\u2019s difficult to see what\u2019s going on. For combining strings in\nmore complicated ways, we can instead use the `format!` macro:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/no-listing-02-format/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis code also sets `s` to `tic-tac-toe`. The `format!` macro works like\n`println!`, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a\n`String` with the contents. The version of the code using `format!` is much\neasier to read, and the code generated by the `format!` macro uses references\nso that this call doesn\u2019t take ownership of any of its parameters.",

    "content": "In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a\nstring by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation. However,\nif you try to access parts of a `String` using indexing syntax in Rust, you\u2019ll\nget an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-19\" caption=\"Attempting to use indexing syntax with a `String`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-19/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will result in the following error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-19/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error tells the story: Rust strings don\u2019t support indexing. But why not? To\nanswer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.\n\n#### Internal Representation\n\nA `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`. Let\u2019s look at some of our properly\nencoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-14/src/main.rs:spanish}}\n```\n\nIn this case, `len` will be `4`, which means the vector storing the string\n`\"Hola\"` is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in\nUTF-8. The following line, however, may surprise you (note that this string\nbegins with the capital Cyrillic letter _Ze_, not the number 3):\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-14/src/main.rs:russian}}\n```\n\nIf you were asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust\u2019s\nanswer is 24: That\u2019s the number of bytes it takes to encode \u201c\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435\u201d in\nUTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of\nstorage. Therefore, an index into the string\u2019s bytes will not always correlate\nto a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust\ncode:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\nlet hello = \"\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435\";\nlet answer = &hello[0];\n```\n\nYou already know that `answer` will not be `\u0417`, the first letter. When encoded\nin UTF-8, the first byte of `\u0417` is `208` and the second is `151`, so it would\nseem that `answer` should in fact be `208`, but `208` is not a valid character\non its own. Returning `208` is likely not what a user would want if they asked\nfor the first letter of this string; however, that\u2019s the only data that Rust\nhas at byte index 0. Users generally don\u2019t want the byte value returned, even\nif the string contains only Latin letters: If `&\"hi\"[0]` were valid code that\nreturned the byte value, it would return `104`, not `h`.\n\nThe answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing\nbugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn\u2019t compile this code\nat all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my\"></a>\n\n#### Bytes, Scalar Values, and Grapheme Clusters\n\nAnother point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to\nlook at strings from Rust\u2019s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme\nclusters (the closest thing to what we would call _letters_).\n\nIf we look at the Hindi word \u201c\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947\u201d written in the Devanagari script, it is\nstored as a vector of `u8` values that looks like this:\n\n```text\n[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,\n224, 165, 135]\n```\n\nThat\u2019s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at\nthem as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust\u2019s `char` type is, those\nbytes look like this:\n\n```text\n['\u0928', '\u092e', '\u0938', '\u094d', '\u0924', '\u0947']\n```\n\nThere are six `char` values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:\nThey\u2019re diacritics that don\u2019t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at\nthem as grapheme clusters, we\u2019d get what a person would call the four letters\nthat make up the Hindi word:\n\n```text\n[\"\u0928\", \"\u092e\", \"\u0938\u094d\", \"\u0924\u0947\"]\n```\n\nRust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers\nstore so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter\nwhat human language the data is in.\n\nA final reason Rust doesn\u2019t allow us to index into a `String` to get a\ncharacter is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time\n(O(1)). But it isn\u2019t possible to guarantee that performance with a `String`,\nbecause Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the\nindex to determine how many valid characters there were.",

    "content": "Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key can\nonly have one value associated with it at a time (but not vice versa: For\nexample, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have the value `10`\nstored in the `scores` hash map).\n\nWhen you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to\nhandle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the\nold value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could\nkeep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the\nkey _doesn\u2019t_ already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the\nnew value. Let\u2019s look at how to do each of these!\n\n#### Overwriting a Value\n\nIf we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key\nwith a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.\nEven though the code in Listing 8-23 calls `insert` twice, the hash map will\nonly contain one key-value pair because we\u2019re inserting the value for the Blue\nteam\u2019s key both times.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-23\" caption=\"Replacing a value stored with a particular key\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-23/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `{\"Blue\": 25}`. The original value of `10` has been\noverwritten.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"only-inserting-a-value-if-the-key-has-no-value\"></a>\n\n#### Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn\u2019t Present\n\nIt\u2019s common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash map\nwith a value and then to take the following actions: If the key does exist in\nthe hash map, the existing value should remain the way it is; if the key\ndoesn\u2019t exist, insert it and a value for it.\n\nHash maps have a special API for this called `entry` that takes the key you\nwant to check as a parameter. The return value of the `entry` method is an enum\ncalled `Entry` that represents a value that might or might not exist. Let\u2019s say\nwe want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated\nwith it. If it doesn\u2019t, we want to insert the value `50`, and the same for the\nBlue team. Using the `entry` API, the code looks like Listing 8-24.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-24\" caption=\"Using the `entry` method to only insert if the key does not already have a value\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-24/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `or_insert` method on `Entry` is defined to return a mutable reference to\nthe value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists, and if not, it\ninserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable\nreference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the\nlogic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.\n\nRunning the code in Listing 8-24 will print `{\"Yellow\": 50, \"Blue\": 10}`. The\nfirst call to `entry` will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value\n`50` because the Yellow team doesn\u2019t have a value already. The second call to\n`entry` will not change the hash map, because the Blue team already has the\nvalue `10`.\n\n#### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value\n\nAnother common use case for hash maps is to look up a key\u2019s value and then\nupdate it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that\ncounts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with\nthe words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we\u2019ve\nseen that word. If it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen a word, we\u2019ll first insert\nthe value `0`.\n\n<Listing number=\"8-25\" caption=\"Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-25/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `{\"world\": 2, \"hello\": 1, \"wonderful\": 1}`. You might see\nthe same key-value pairs printed in a different order: Recall from [\u201cAccessing\nValues in a Hash Map\u201d][access]<!-- ignore --> that iterating over a hash map\nhappens in an arbitrary order.\n\nThe `split_whitespace` method returns an iterator over subslices, separated by\nwhitespace, of the value in `text`. The `or_insert` method returns a mutable\nreference (`&mut V`) to the value for the specified key. Here, we store that\nmutable reference in the `count` variable, so in order to assign to that value,\nwe must first dereference `count` using the asterisk (`*`). The mutable\nreference goes out of scope at the end of the `for` loop, so all of these\nchanges are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.",

In many cases, Rust requires\nyou to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your\ncode will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring\nthat you\u2019ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before deploying your\ncode to production!\n\nRust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable\nerrors. For a _recoverable error_, such as a _file not found_ error, we most\nlikely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation.\n_Unrecoverable errors_ are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a\nlocation beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the\nprogram.\n\nMost languages don\u2019t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle\nboth in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn\u2019t have\nexceptions. Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and\nthe `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an\nunrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling `panic!` first and then talks\nabout returning `Result<T, E>` values.

    "content": "## Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`\n\nSometimes bad things happen in your code, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about\nit. In these cases, Rust has the `panic!` macro. There are two ways to cause a\npanic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic (such as\naccessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the `panic!` macro.\nIn both cases, we cause a panic in our program. By default, these panics will\nprint a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an\nenvironment variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a\npanic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic.\n\n> ### Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic\n>\n> By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts _unwinding_, which means\n> Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it\n> encounters. However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust\n> therefore allows you to choose the alternative of immediately _aborting_,\n> which ends the program without cleaning up.\n>\n> Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the\n> operating system. If in your project you need to make the resultant binary as\n> small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by\n> adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in your\n> _Cargo.toml_ file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release mode,\n> add this:\n>\n> ```toml\n> [profile.release]\n> panic = 'abort'\n> ```\n\nLet\u2019s try calling `panic!` in a simple program:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,should_panic,panics\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-01-panic/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen you run the program, you\u2019ll see something like this:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-01-panic/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe call to `panic!` causes the error message contained in the last two lines.\nThe first line shows our panic message and the place in our source code where\nthe panic occurred: _src/main.rs:2:5_ indicates that it\u2019s the second line,\nfifth character of our _src/main.rs_ file.\n\nIn this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that\nline, we see the `panic!` macro call. In other cases, the `panic!` call might\nbe in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by\nthe error message will be someone else\u2019s code where the `panic!` macro is\ncalled, not the line of our code that eventually led to the `panic!` call.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"using-a-panic-backtrace\"></a>\n\nWe can use the backtrace of the functions the `panic!` call came from to figure\nout the part of our code that is causing the problem. To understand how to use\na `panic!` backtrace, let\u2019s look at another example and see what it\u2019s like when\na `panic!` call comes from a library because of a bug in our code instead of\nfrom our code calling the macro directly. Listing 9-1 has some code that\nattempts to access an index in a vector beyond the range of valid indexes.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to access an element beyond the end of a vector, which will cause a call to `panic!`\">\n\n```rust,should_panic,panics\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-01/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we\u2019re attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which is at\nindex 99 because indexing starts at zero), but the vector has only three\nelements. In this situation, Rust will panic. Using `[]` is supposed to return\nan element, but if you pass an invalid index, there\u2019s no element that Rust\ncould return here that would be correct.\n\nIn C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined\nbehavior. You might get whatever is at the location in memory that would\ncorrespond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory\ndoesn\u2019t belong to that structure. This is called a _buffer overread_ and can\nlead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the index\nin such a way as to read data they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to that is stored after\nthe data structure.\n\nTo protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an\nelement at an index that doesn\u2019t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to\ncontinue. Let\u2019s try it and see:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-01/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis error points at line 4 of our _main.rs_ where we attempt to access index\n99 of the vector in `v`.\n\nThe `note:` line tells us that we can set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment\nvariable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error. A\n_backtrace_ is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this\npoint. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: The key to\nreading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see files you\nwrote. That\u2019s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above that spot\nare code that your code has called; the lines below are code that called your\ncode. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code, standard\nlibrary code, or crates that you\u2019re using. Let\u2019s try to get a backtrace by\nsetting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to any value except `0`.\nListing 9-2 shows output similar to what you\u2019ll see.\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-01\nRUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run\ncopy the backtrace output below\ncheck the backtrace number mentioned in the text below the listing\n-->\n\n<Listing number=\"9-2\" caption=\"The backtrace generated by a call to `panic!` displayed when the environment variable `RUST_BACKTRACE` is set\">\n\n```console\n$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run\nthread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:\nindex out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99\nstack backtrace:\n   0: rust_begin_unwind\n             at /rustc/4d91de4e48198da2e33413efdcd9cd2cc0c46688/library/std/src/panicking.rs:692:5\n   1: core::panicking::panic_fmt\n             at /rustc/4d91de4e48198da2e33413efdcd9cd2cc0c46688/library/core/src/panicking.rs:75:14\n   2: core::panicking::panic_bounds_check\n             at /rustc/4d91de4e48198da2e33413efdcd9cd2cc0c46688/library/core/src/panicking.rs:273:5\n   3: <usize as core::slice::index::SliceIndex<[T]>>::index\n             at file:///home/.rustup/toolchains/1.85/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/slice/index.rs:274:10\n   4: core::slice::index::<impl core::ops::index::Index<I> for [T]>::index\n             at file:///home/.rustup/toolchains/1.85/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/slice/index.rs:16:9\n   5: <alloc::vec::Vec<T,A> as core::ops::index::Index<I>>::index\n             at file:///home/.rustup/toolchains/1.85/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs:3361:9\n   6: panic::main\n             at ./src/main.rs:4:6\n   7: core::ops::function::FnOnce::call_once\n             at file:///home/.rustup/toolchains/1.85/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/ops/function.rs:250:5\nnote: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of output!

For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails\nbecause the file doesn\u2019t exist, you might want to create the file instead of\nterminating the process.\n\nRecall from [\u201cHandling Potential Failure with `Result`\u201d][handle_failure]<!--\nignore --> in Chapter 2 that the `Result` enum is defined as having two\nvariants, `Ok` and `Err`, as follows:\n\n```rust\nenum Result<T, E> {\n    Ok(T),\n    Err(E),\n}\n```\n\nThe `T` and `E` are generic type parameters: We\u2019ll discuss generics in more\ndetail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that `T` represents\nthe type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok`\nvariant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a\nfailure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type\nparameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in\nmany different situations where the success value and error value we want to\nreturn may differ.\n\nLet\u2019s call a function that returns a `Result` value because the function could\nfail.

The type of `E` used in\nthe error value is `std::io::Error`. This return type means the call to\n`File::open` might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or\nwrite to. The function call also might fail: For example, the file might not\nexist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The `File::open`\nfunction needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at\nthe same time give us either the file handle or error information. This\ninformation is exactly what the `Result` enum conveys.\n\nIn the case where `File::open` succeeds, the value in the variable\n`greeting_file_result` will be an instance of `Ok` that contains a file handle.\nIn the case where it fails, the value in `greeting_file_result` will be an\ninstance of `Err` that contains more information about the kind of error that\noccurred.\n\nWe need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending\non the value `File::open` returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the\n`Result` using a basic tool, the `match` expression that we discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using a `match` expression to handle the `Result` variants that might be returned\">\n\n```rust,should_panic\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-04/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that, like the `Option` enum, the `Result` enum and its variants have been\nbrought into scope by the prelude, so we don\u2019t need to specify `Result::`\nbefore the `Ok` and `Err` variants in the `match` arms.\n\nWhen the result is `Ok`, this code will return the inner `file` value out of\nthe `Ok` variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable\n`greeting_file`. After the `match`, we can use the file handle for reading or\nwriting.\n\nThe other arm of the `match` handles the case where we get an `Err` value from\n`File::open`. In this example, we\u2019ve chosen to call the `panic!` macro. If\nthere\u2019s no file named _hello.txt_ in our current directory and we run this\ncode, we\u2019ll see the following output from the `panic!` macro:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-04/output.txt}}\n```\n\nAs usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.",

If\n`File::open` failed because the file doesn\u2019t exist, we want to create the file\nand return the handle to the new file. If `File::open` failed for any other\nreason\u2014for example, because we didn\u2019t have permission to open the file\u2014we still\nwant the code to `panic!` in the same way it did in Listing 9-4.

This struct\nhas a method, `kind`, that we can call to get an `io::ErrorKind` value. The\nenum `io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants\nrepresenting the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io`\noperation. The variant we want to use is `ErrorKind::NotFound`, which indicates\nthe file we\u2019re trying to open doesn\u2019t exist yet. So, we match on\n`greeting_file_result`, but we also have an inner match on `error.kind()`.\n\nThe condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned\nby `error.kind()` is the `NotFound` variant of the `ErrorKind` enum. If it is,\nwe try to create the file with `File::create`. However, because `File::create`\ncould also fail, we need a second arm in the inner `match` expression. When the\nfile can\u2019t be created, a different error message is printed.

The `Result<T, E>` type has many helper methods\ndefined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The `unwrap` method is a\nshortcut method implemented just like the `match` expression we wrote in\nListing 9-4. If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant, `unwrap` will return\nthe value inside the `Ok`. If the `Result` is the `Err` variant, `unwrap` will\ncall the `panic!` macro for us. Here is an example of `unwrap` in action:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,should_panic\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-04-unwrap/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf we run this code without a _hello.txt_ file, we\u2019ll see an error message from\nthe `panic!` call that the `unwrap` method makes:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-04-unwrap\ncargo run\ncopy and paste relevant text\n-->\n\n```text\nthread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:49:\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" }\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `expect` method lets us also choose the `panic!` error message.\nUsing `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can convey\nyour intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax of\n`expect` looks like this:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,should_panic\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-05-expect/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe use `expect` in the same way as `unwrap`: to return the file handle or call\nthe `panic!` macro. The error message used by `expect` in its call to `panic!`\nwill be the parameter that we pass to `expect`, rather than the default\n`panic!` message that `unwrap` uses. Here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-05-expect\ncargo run\ncopy and paste relevant text\n-->\n\n```text\nthread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:5:10:\nhello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" }\n```\n\nIn production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose `expect` rather than\n`unwrap` and give more context about why the operation is expected to always\nsucceed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more\ninformation to use in debugging.",

    "content": "When a function\u2019s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of\nhandling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the\ncalling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as _propagating_\nthe error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more\ninformation or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what\nyou have available in the context of your code.\n\nFor example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If\nthe file doesn\u2019t exist or can\u2019t be read, this function will return those errors\nto the code that called the function.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A function that returns errors to the calling code using `match`\">\n\n<!-- Deliberately not using rustdoc_include here; the `main` function in the\nfile panics. We do want to include it for reader experimentation purposes, but\ndon't want to include it for rustdoc testing purposes. -->\n\n```rust\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis function can be written in a much shorter way, but we\u2019re going to start by\ndoing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling; at the end,\nwe\u2019ll show the shorter way. Let\u2019s look at the return type of the function\nfirst: `Result<String, io::Error>`. This means the function is returning a\nvalue of the type `Result<T, E>`, where the generic parameter `T` has been\nfilled in with the concrete type `String` and the generic type `E` has been\nfilled in with the concrete type `io::Error`.\n\nIf this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this\nfunction will receive an `Ok` value that holds a `String`\u2014the `username` that\nthis function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems, the\ncalling code will receive an `Err` value that holds an instance of `io::Error`\nthat contains more information about what the problems were. We chose\n`io::Error` as the return type of this function because that happens to be the\ntype of the error value returned from both of the operations we\u2019re calling in\nthis function\u2019s body that might fail: the `File::open` function and the\n`read_to_string` method.\n\nThe body of the function starts by calling the `File::open` function. Then, we\nhandle the `Result` value with a `match` similar to the `match` in Listing 9-4.\nIf `File::open` succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable `file`\nbecomes the value in the mutable variable `username_file` and the function\ncontinues. In the `Err` case, instead of calling `panic!`, we use the `return`\nkeyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value\nfrom `File::open`, now in the pattern variable `e`, back to the calling code as\nthis function\u2019s error value.\n\nSo, if we have a file handle in `username_file`, the function then creates a\nnew `String` in variable `username` and calls the `read_to_string` method on\nthe file handle in `username_file` to read the contents of the file into\n`username`. The `read_to_string` method also returns a `Result` because it\nmight fail, even though `File::open` succeeded. So, we need another `match` to\nhandle that `Result`: If `read_to_string` succeeds, then our function has\nsucceeded, and we return the username from the file that\u2019s now in `username`\nwrapped in an `Ok`. If `read_to_string` fails, we return the error value in the\nsame way that we returned the error value in the `match` that handled the\nreturn value of `File::open`. However, we don\u2019t need to explicitly say\n`return`, because this is the last expression in the function.\n\nThe code that calls this code will then handle getting either an `Ok` value\nthat contains a username or an `Err` value that contains an `io::Error`. It\u2019s\nup to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling\ncode gets an `Err` value, it could call `panic!` and crash the program, use a\ndefault username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for\nexample. We don\u2019t have enough information on what the calling code is actually\ntrying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upward for\nit to handle appropriately.\n\nThis pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the\nquestion mark operator `?` to make this easier.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator\"></a>\n\n#### The `?` Operator Shortcut\n\nListing 9-7 shows an implementation of `read_username_from_file` that has the\nsame functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the `?`\noperator.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A function that returns errors to the calling code using the `?` operator\">\n\n<!-- Deliberately not using rustdoc_include here; the `main` function in the\nfile panics. We do want to include it for reader experimentation purposes, but\ndon't want to include it for rustdoc testing purposes. -->\n\n```rust\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-07/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `?` placed after a `Result` value is defined to work in almost the same way\nas the `match` expressions that we defined to handle the `Result` values in\nListing 9-6. If the value of the `Result` is an `Ok`, the value inside the `Ok`\nwill get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the\nvalue is an `Err`, the `Err` will be returned from the whole function as if we\nhad used the `return` keyword so that the error value gets propagated to the\ncalling code.\n\nThere is a difference between what the `match` expression from Listing 9-6 does\nand what the `?` operator does: Error values that have the `?` operator called\non them go through the `from` function, defined in the `From` trait in the\nstandard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another.\nWhen the `?` operator calls the `from` function, the error type received is\nconverted into the error type defined in the return type of the current\nfunction. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent\nall the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different\nreasons.\n\nFor example, we could change the `read_username_from_file` function in Listing\n9-7 to return a custom error type named `OurError` that we define. If we also\ndefine `impl From<io::Error> for OurError` to construct an instance of\n`OurError` from an `io::Error`, then the `?` operator calls in the body of\n`read_username_from_file` will call `from` and convert the error types without\nneeding to add any more code to the function.\n\nIn the context of Listing 9-7, the `?` at the end of the `File::open` call will\nreturn the value inside an `Ok` to the variable `username_file`. If an error\noccurs, the `?` operator will return early out of the whole function and give\nany `Err` value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the `?` at the\nend of the `read_to_string` call.\n\nThe `?` operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function\u2019s\nimplementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining\nmethod calls immediately after the `?`, as shown in Listing 9-8.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Chaining method calls after the `?` operator\">\n\n<!-- Deliberately not using rustdoc_include here; the `main` function in the\nfile panics. We do want to include it for reader experimentation purposes, but\ndon't want to include it for rustdoc testing purposes. -->\n\n```rust\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve moved the creation of the new `String` in `username` to the beginning of\nthe function; that part hasn\u2019t changed. Instead of creating a variable\n`username_file`, we\u2019ve chained the call to `read_to_string` directly onto the\nresult of `File::open(\"hello.txt\")?`. We still have a `?` at the end of the\n`read_to_string` call, and we still return an `Ok` value containing `username`\nwhen both `File::open` and `read_to_string` succeed rather than returning\nerrors. The functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7;\nthis is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.\n\nListing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using `fs::read_to_string`.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-9\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using `fs::read_to_string` instead of opening and then reading the file\">\n\n<!-- Deliberately not using rustdoc_include here; the `main` function in the\nfile panics.

Of course, using `fs::read_to_string`\ndoesn\u2019t give us the opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it\nthe longer way first.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"where-the--operator-can-be-used\"></a>\n\n#### Where to Use the `?` Operator\n\nThe `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible\nwith the value the `?` is used on. This is because the `?` operator is defined\nto perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner\nas the `match` expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the\n`match` was using a `Result` value, and the early return arm returned an\n`Err(e)` value. The return type of the function has to be a `Result` so that\nit\u2019s compatible with this `return`.\n\nIn Listing 9-10, let\u2019s look at the error we\u2019ll get if we use the `?` operator\nin a `main` function with a return type that is incompatible with the type of\nthe value we use `?` on.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to use the `?` in the `main` function that returns `()` won\u2019t compile.\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-10/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code opens a file, which might fail. The `?` operator follows the `Result`\nvalue returned by `File::open`, but this `main` function has the return type of\n`()`, not `Result`. When we compile this code, we get the following error\nmessage:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-10/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis error points out that we\u2019re only allowed to use the `?` operator in a\nfunction that returns `Result`, `Option`, or another type that implements\n`FromResidual`.\n\nTo fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type\nof your function to be compatible with the value you\u2019re using the `?` operator\non as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other choice is to\nuse a `match` or one of the `Result<T, E>` methods to handle the `Result<T, E>`\nin whatever way is appropriate.\n\nThe error message also mentioned that `?` can be used with `Option<T>` values\nas well. As with using `?` on `Result`, you can only use `?` on `Option` in a\nfunction that returns an `Option`. The behavior of the `?` operator when called\non an `Option<T>` is similar to its behavior when called on a `Result<T, E>`:\nIf the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from the function at\nthat point. If the value is `Some`, the value inside the `Some` is the\nresultant value of the expression, and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has\nan example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the\ngiven text.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-11\" caption=\"Using the `?` operator on an `Option<T>` value\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis function returns `Option<char>` because it\u2019s possible that there is a\ncharacter there, but it\u2019s also possible that there isn\u2019t. This code takes the\n`text` string slice argument and calls the `lines` method on it, which returns\nan iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to\nexamine the first line, it calls `next` on the iterator to get the first value\nfrom the iterator. If `text` is the empty string, this call to `next` will\nreturn `None`, in which case we use `?` to stop and return `None` from\n`last_char_of_first_line`. If `text` is not the empty string, `next` will\nreturn a `Some` value containing a string slice of the first line in `text`.\n\nThe `?` extracts the string slice, and we can call `chars` on that string slice\nto get an iterator of its characters. We\u2019re interested in the last character in\nthis first line, so we call `last` to return the last item in the iterator.\nThis is an `Option` because it\u2019s possible that the first line is the empty\nstring; for example, if `text` starts with a blank line but has characters on\nother lines, as in `\"\\nhi\"`. However, if there is a last character on the first\nline, it will be returned in the `Some` variant. The `?` operator in the middle\ngives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the\nfunction in one line. If we couldn\u2019t use the `?` operator on `Option`, we\u2019d\nhave to implement this logic using more method calls or a `match` expression.\n\nNote that you can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function that returns\n`Result`, and you can use the `?` operator on an `Option` in a function that\nreturns `Option`, but you can\u2019t mix and match. The `?` operator won\u2019t\nautomatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa; in those cases,\nyou can use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or` method on\n`Option` to do the conversion explicitly.\n\nSo far, all the `main` functions we\u2019ve used return `()`. The `main` function is\nspecial because it\u2019s the entry point and exit point of an executable program,\nand there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the program to\nbehave as expected.\n\nLuckily, `main` can also return a `Result<(), E>`. Listing 9-12 has the code\nfrom Listing 9-10, but we\u2019ve changed the return type of `main` to be\n`Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>` and added a return value `Ok(())` to the end. This\ncode will now compile.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-12\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Changing `main` to return `Result<(), E>` allows the use of the `?` operator on `Result` values.\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-12/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `Box<dyn Error>` type is a trait object, which we\u2019ll talk about in [\u201cUsing\nTrait Objects to Abstract over Shared Behavior\u201d][trait-objects]<!-- ignore -->\nin Chapter 18. For now, you can read `Box<dyn Error>` to mean \u201cany kind of\nerror.\u201d Using `?` on a `Result` value in a `main` function with the error type\n`Box<dyn Error>` is allowed because it allows any `Err` value to be returned\nearly. Even though the body of this `main` function will only ever return\nerrors of type `std::io::Error`, by specifying `Box<dyn Error>`, this signature\nwill continue to be correct even if more code that returns other errors is\nadded to the body of `main`.\n\nWhen a `main` function returns a `Result<(), E>`, the executable will exit with\na value of `0` if `main` returns `Ok(())` and will exit with a nonzero value if\n`main` returns an `Err` value. Executables written in C return integers when\nthey exit: Programs that exit successfully return the integer `0`, and programs\nthat error return some integer other than `0`.

When you choose to return a `Result` value, you give the\ncalling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a\nway that\u2019s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an `Err`\nvalue in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call `panic!` and turn your\nrecoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning `Result` is a\ngood default choice when you\u2019re defining a function that might fail.\n\nIn situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it\u2019s more\nappropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a `Result`.

    "content": "It\u2019s advisable to have your code panic when it\u2019s possible that your code could\nend up in a bad state. In this context, a _bad state_ is when some assumption,\nguarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values,\ncontradictory values, or missing values are passed to your code\u2014plus one or\nmore of the following:\n\n- The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that\n  will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong\n  format.\n- Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,\n  rather than checking for the problem at every step.\n- There\u2019s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We\u2019ll\n  work through an example of what we mean in [\u201cEncoding States and Behavior as\n  Types\u201d][encoding]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 18.\n\nIf someone calls your code and passes in values that don\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s\nbest to return an error if you can so that the user of the library can decide\nwhat they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be\ninsecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call `panic!` and alert the\nperson using your library to the bug in their code so that they can fix it\nduring development. Similarly, `panic!` is often appropriate if you\u2019re calling\nexternal code that is out of your control and returns an invalid state that you\nhave no way of fixing.\n\nHowever, when failure is expected, it\u2019s more appropriate to return a `Result`\nthan to make a `panic!` call. Examples include a parser being given malformed\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate\nlimit. In these cases, returning a `Result` indicates that failure is an\nexpected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.\n\nWhen your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it\u2019s\ncalled using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first\nand panic if the values aren\u2019t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:\nAttempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.\nThis is the main reason the standard library will call `panic!` if you attempt\nan out-of-bounds memory access: Trying to access memory that doesn\u2019t belong to\nthe current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have\n_contracts_: Their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular\nrequirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a\ncontract violation always indicates a caller-side bug, and it\u2019s not a kind of\nerror you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there\u2019s\nno reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling _programmers_ need\nto fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will\ncause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.\n\nHowever, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose\nand annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust\u2019s type system (and thus the type\nchecking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your\nfunction has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code\u2019s\nlogic knowing that the compiler has already ensured that you have a valid\nvalue. For example, if you have a type rather than an `Option`, your program\nexpects to have _something_ rather than _nothing_. Your code then doesn\u2019t have\nto handle two cases for the `Some` and `None` variants: It will only have one\ncase for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your\nfunction won\u2019t even compile, so your function doesn\u2019t have to check for that\ncase at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as\n`u32`, which ensures that the parameter is never negative.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Let\u2019s take the idea of using Rust\u2019s type system to ensure that we have a valid\nvalue one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation.\nRecall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess\na number between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user\u2019s guess was\nbetween those numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only\nvalidated that the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not\nvery dire: Our output of \u201cToo high\u201d or \u201cToo low\u201d would still be correct. But it\nwould be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have\ndifferent behavior when the user guesses a number that\u2019s out of range versus\nwhen the user types, for example, letters instead.\n\nOne way to do this would be to parse the guess as an `i32` instead of only a\n`u32` to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the\nnumber being in range, like so:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-09-guess-out-of-range/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `if` expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user\nabout the problem, and calls `continue` to start the next iteration of the loop\nand ask for another guess. After the `if` expression, we can proceed with the\ncomparisons between `guess` and the secret number knowing that `guess` is\nbetween 1 and 100.\n\nHowever, this is not an ideal solution: If it were absolutely critical that the\nprogram only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions\nwith this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be\ntedious (and might impact performance).\n\nInstead, we can make a new type in a dedicated module and put the validations\nin a function to create an instance of the type rather than repeating the\nvalidations everywhere. That way, it\u2019s safe for functions to use the new type\nin their signatures and confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13\nshows one way to define a `Guess` type that will only create an instance of\n`Guess` if the `new` function receives a value between 1 and 100.\n\n<Listing number=\"9-13\" caption=\"A `Guess` type that will only continue with values between 1 and 100\" file-name=\"src/guessing_game.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch09-error-handling/listing-09-13/src/guessing_game.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that this code in *src/guessing_game.rs* depends on adding a module\ndeclaration `mod guessing_game;` in *src/lib.rs* that we haven\u2019t shown here.\nWithin this new module\u2019s file, we define a struct named `Guess` that has a\nfield named `value` that holds an `i32`. This is where the number will be\nstored.\n\nThen, we implement an associated function named `new` on `Guess` that creates\ninstances of `Guess` values. The `new` function is defined to have one\nparameter named `value` of type `i32` and to return a `Guess`. The code in the\nbody of the `new` function tests `value` to make sure it\u2019s between 1 and 100.\nIf `value` doesn\u2019t pass this test, we make a `panic!` call, which will alert\nthe programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need\nto fix, because creating a `Guess` with a `value` outside this range would\nviolate the contract that `Guess::new` is relying on. The conditions in which\n`Guess::new` might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API\ndocumentation; we\u2019ll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility\nof a `panic!` in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If\n`value` does pass the test, we create a new `Guess` with its `value` field set\nto the `value` parameter and return the `Guess`.\n\nNext, we implement a method named `value` that borrows `self`, doesn\u2019t have any\nother parameters, and returns an `i32`. This kind of method is sometimes called\na _getter_ because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return\nit. This public method is necessary because the `value` field of the `Guess`\nstruct is private. It\u2019s important that the `value` field be private so that\ncode using the `Guess` struct is not allowed to set `value` directly: Code\noutside the `guessing_game` module _must_ use the `Guess::new` function to\ncreate an instance of `Guess`, thereby ensuring that there\u2019s no way for a\n`Guess` to have a `value` that hasn\u2019t been checked by the conditions in the\n`Guess::new` function.\n\nA function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could\nthen declare in its signature that it takes or returns a `Guess` rather than an\n`i32` and wouldn\u2019t need to do any additional checks in its body.\n\n## Summary\n\nRust\u2019s error-handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.\nThe `panic!` macro signals that your program is in a state it can\u2019t handle and\nlets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or\nincorrect values. The `Result` enum uses Rust\u2019s type system to indicate that\noperations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use\n`Result` to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential\nsuccess or failure as well. Using `panic!` and `Result` in the appropriate\nsituations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with\nthe `Option` and `Result` enums, we\u2019ll talk about how generics work and how you\ncan use them in your code.\n\n[encoding]: ch18-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types",

    "content": "# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes\n\nEvery programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication\nof concepts. In Rust, one such tool is _generics_: abstract stand-ins for\nconcrete types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or\nhow they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place\nwhen compiling and running the code.\n\nFunctions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type\nlike `i32` or `String`, in the same way they take parameters with unknown\nvalues to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we already\nused generics in Chapter 6 with `Option<T>`, in Chapter 8 with `Vec<T>` and\n`HashMap<K, V>`, and in Chapter 9 with `Result<T, E>`. In this chapter, you\u2019ll\nexplore how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. We\u2019ll\nthen use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that\ndiffer only in the types of their parameters. We\u2019ll also explain how to use\ngeneric types in struct and enum definitions.\n\nThen, you\u2019ll learn how to use traits to define behavior in a generic way. You\ncan combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept\nonly those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll discuss _lifetimes_: a variety of generics that give the\ncompiler information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes allow\nus to give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that it can\nensure that references will be valid in more situations than it could without\nour help.\n\n## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function\n\nGenerics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that represents\nmultiple types to remove code duplication. Before diving into generics syntax,\nlet\u2019s first look at how to remove duplication in a way that doesn\u2019t involve\ngeneric types by extracting a function that replaces specific values with a\nplaceholder that represents multiple values. Then, we\u2019ll apply the same\ntechnique to extract a generic function! By looking at how to recognize\nduplicated code you can extract into a function, you\u2019ll start to recognize\nduplicated code that can use generics.\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with the short program in Listing 10-1 that finds the largest\nnumber in a list.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Finding the largest number in a list of numbers\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-01/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe store a list of integers in the variable `number_list` and place a reference\nto the first number in the list in a variable named `largest`. We then iterate\nthrough all the numbers in the list, and if the current number is greater than\nthe number stored in `largest`, we replace the reference in that variable.\nHowever, if the current number is less than or equal to the largest number seen\nso far, the variable doesn\u2019t change, and the code moves on to the next number\nin the list. After considering all the numbers in the list, `largest` should\nrefer to the largest number, which in this case is 100.\n\nWe\u2019ve now been tasked with finding the largest number in two different lists of\nnumbers. To do so, we can choose to duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and use\nthe same logic at two different places in the program, as shown in Listing 10-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Code to find the largest number in *two* lists of numbers\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-02/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAlthough this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error-prone. We also\nhave to remember to update the code in multiple places when we want to change\nit.\n\nTo eliminate this duplication, we\u2019ll create an abstraction by defining a\nfunction that operates on any list of integers passed in as a parameter. This\nsolution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of finding the\nlargest number in a list abstractly.\n\nIn Listing 10-3, we extract the code that finds the largest number into a\nfunction named `largest`. Then, we call the function to find the largest number\nin the two lists from Listing 10-2. We could also use the function on any other\nlist of `i32` values we might have in the future.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Abstracted code to find the largest number in two lists\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `largest` function has a parameter called `list`, which represents any\nconcrete slice of `i32` values we might pass into the function. As a result,\nwhen we call the function, the code runs on the specific values that we pass\nin.\n\nIn summary, here are the steps we took to change the code from Listing 10-2 to\nListing 10-3:\n\n1. Identify duplicate code.\n1. Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function, and specify the\n   inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.\n1. Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function instead.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication. In\nthe same way that the function body can operate on an abstract `list` instead\nof specific values, generics allow code to operate on abstract types.\n\nFor example, say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item in a\nslice of `i32` values and one that finds the largest item in a slice of `char`\nvalues. How would we eliminate that duplication? Let\u2019s find out!",

Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides\nmore functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.\n\nContinuing with our `largest` function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that\nboth find the largest value in a slice. We\u2019ll then combine these into a single\nfunction that uses generics.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Two functions that differ only in their names and in the types in their signatures\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `largest_i32` function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds\nthe largest `i32` in a slice. The `largest_char` function finds the largest\n`char` in a slice. The function bodies have the same code, so let\u2019s eliminate\nthe duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.\n\nTo parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type\nparameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. You can use\nany identifier as a type parameter name. But we\u2019ll use `T` because, by\nconvention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just one letter, and\nRust\u2019s type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase. Short for _type_, `T` is the\ndefault choice of most Rust programmers.\n\nWhen we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the\nparameter name in the signature so that the compiler knows what that name\nmeans. Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we\nhave to declare the type parameter name before we use it. To define the generic\n`largest` function, we place type name declarations inside angle brackets,\n`<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {\n```\n\nWe read this definition as \u201cThe function `largest` is generic over some type\n`T`.\u201d This function has one parameter named `list`, which is a slice of values\nof type `T`. The `largest` function will return a reference to a value of the\nsame type `T`.\n\nListing 10-5 shows the combined `largest` function definition using the generic\ndata type in its signature.

First, we declare the name of the type parameter inside\nangle brackets just after the name of the struct. Then, we use the generic type\nin the struct definition where we would otherwise specify concrete data types.\n\nNote that because we\u2019ve used only one generic type to define `Point<T>`, this\ndefinition says that the `Point<T>` struct is generic over some type `T`, and\nthe fields `x` and `y` are _both_ that same type, whatever that type may be.

As you can see, the\n`Option<T>` enum is generic over type `T` and has two variants: `Some`, which\nholds one value of type `T`, and a `None` variant that doesn\u2019t hold any value.\nBy using the `Option<T>` enum, we can express the abstract concept of an\noptional value, and because `Option<T>` is generic, we can use this abstraction\nno matter what the type of the optional value is.\n\nEnums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the `Result`\nenum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:\n\n```rust\nenum Result<T, E> {\n    Ok(T),\n    Err(E),\n}\n```\n\nThe `Result` enum is generic over two types, `T` and `E`, and has two variants:\n`Ok`, which holds a value of type `T`, and `Err`, which holds a value of type\n`E`. This definition makes it convenient to use the `Result` enum anywhere we\nhave an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type `T`) or fail\n(return an error of some type `E`). In fact, this is what we used to open a\nfile in Listing 9-3, where `T` was filled in with the type `std::fs::File` when\nthe file was opened successfully and `E` was filled in with the type\n`std::io::Error` when there were problems opening the file.\n\nWhen you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum\ndefinitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can\navoid duplication by using generic types instead.",

By declaring\n`T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the\nangle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type. We\ncould have chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic\nparameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is\nconventional. If you write a method within an `impl` that declares a generic\ntype, that method will be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what\nconcrete type ends up substituting for the generic type.\n\nWe can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the\ntype. We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances\nrather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10, we\nuse the concrete type `f32`, meaning we don\u2019t declare any types after `impl`.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"An `impl` block that only applies to a struct with a particular concrete type for the generic type parameter `T`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-10/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a `distance_from_origin`\nmethod; other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of type `f32` will not\nhave this method defined. The method measures how far our point is from the\npoint at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical operations that are\navailable only for floating-point types.\n\nGeneric type parameters in a struct definition aren\u2019t always the same as those\nyou use in that same struct\u2019s method signatures. Listing 10-11 uses the generic\ntypes `X1` and `Y1` for the `Point` struct and `X2` and `Y2` for the `mixup`\nmethod signature to make the example clearer. The method creates a new `Point`\ninstance with the `x` value from the `self` `Point` (of type `X1`) and the `y`\nvalue from the passed-in `Point` (of type `Y2`).\n\n<Listing number=\"10-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A method that uses generic types that are different from its struct\u2019s definition\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-11/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn `main`, we\u2019ve defined a `Point` that has an `i32` for `x` (with value `5`)\nand an `f64` for `y` (with value `10.4`).

Calling `mixup` on `p1` with the argument `p2` gives us `p3`,\nwhich will have an `i32` for `x` because `x` came from `p1`. The `p3` variable\nwill have a `char` for `y` because `y` came from `p2`. The `println!` macro\ncall will print `p3.x = 5, p3.y = c`.\n\nThe purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some generic\nparameters are declared with `impl` and some are declared with the method\ndefinition.

The good news is that using generic types won\u2019t make your program\nrun any slower than it would with concrete types.\n\nRust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using\ngenerics at compile time. _Monomorphization_ is the process of turning generic\ncode into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when\ncompiled. In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used\nto create the generic function in Listing 10-5: The compiler looks at all the\nplaces where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types\nthe generic code is called with.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how this works by using the standard library\u2019s generic\n`Option<T>` enum:\n\n```rust\nlet integer = Some(5);\nlet float = Some(5.0);\n```\n\nWhen Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization. During that\nprocess, the compiler reads the values that have been used in `Option<T>`\ninstances and identifies two kinds of `Option<T>`: One is `i32` and the other\nis `f64`. As such, it expands the generic definition of `Option<T>` into two\ndefinitions specialized to `i32` and `f64`, thereby replacing the generic\ndefinition with the specific ones.\n\nThe monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the\ncompiler uses different names than what we\u2019re using here for illustration):\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\nenum Option_i32 {\n    Some(i32),\n    None,\n}\n\nenum Option_f64 {\n    Some(f64),\n    None,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);\n    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);\n}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe generic `Option<T>` is replaced with the specific definitions created by\nthe compiler. Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the\ntype in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics.

Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to\ndefine a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and\namounts of text: a `NewsArticle` struct that holds a news story filed in a\nparticular location and a `SocialPost` that can have, at most, 280 characters\nalong with metadata that indicates whether it was a new post, a repost, or a\nreply to another post.\n\nWe want to make a media aggregator library crate named `aggregator` that can\ndisplay summaries of data that might be stored in a `NewsArticle` or\n`SocialPost` instance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we\u2019ll\nrequest that summary by calling a `summarize` method on an instance. Listing\n10-12 shows the definition of a public `Summary` trait that expresses this\nbehavior.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-12\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `Summary` trait that consists of the behavior provided by a `summarize` method\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-12/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we declare a trait using the `trait` keyword and then the trait\u2019s name,\nwhich is `Summary` in this case.

Each type implementing this trait must provide\nits own custom behavior for the body of the method.

Listing 10-13 shows\nan implementation of the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` struct that uses\nthe headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of\n`summarize`. For the `SocialPost` struct, we define `summarize` as the username\nfollowed by the entire text of the post, assuming that the post content is\nalready limited to 280 characters.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-13\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` and `SocialPost` types\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-13/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nImplementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The\ndifference is that after `impl`, we put the trait name we want to implement,\nthen use the `for` keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to\nimplement the trait for. Within the `impl` block, we put the method signatures\nthat the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each\nsignature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific\nbehavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.\n\nNow that the library has implemented the `Summary` trait on `NewsArticle` and\n`SocialPost`, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of\n`NewsArticle` and `SocialPost` in the same way we call regular methods. The only\ndifference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the\ntypes. Here\u2019s an example of how a binary crate could use our `aggregator`\nlibrary crate:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-01-calling-trait-method/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\nThis code prints `1 new post: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already\nknow, people`.\n\nOther crates that depend on the `aggregator` crate can also bring the `Summary`\ntrait into scope to implement `Summary` on their own types. One restriction to\nnote is that we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the\ntype, or both, are local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard\nlibrary traits like `Display` on a custom type like `SocialPost` as part of our\n`aggregator` crate functionality because the type `SocialPost` is local to our\n`aggregator` crate. We can also implement `Summary` on `Vec<T>` in our\n`aggregator` crate because the trait `Summary` is local to our `aggregator`\ncrate.\n\nBut we can\u2019t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can\u2019t\nimplement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate,\nbecause `Display` and `Vec<T>` are both defined in the standard library and\naren\u2019t local to our `aggregator` crate. This restriction is part of a property\ncalled _coherence_, and more specifically the _orphan rule_, so named because\nthe parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people\u2019s code\ncan\u2019t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could\nimplement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn\u2019t know which\nimplementation to use.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

In this way, a trait can\nprovide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify\na small part of it. For example, we could define the `Summary` trait to have a\n`summarize_author` method whose implementation is required, and then define a\n`summarize` method that has a default implementation that calls the\n`summarize_author` method:\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-03-default-impl-calls-other-methods/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nTo use this version of `Summary`, we only need to define `summarize_author`\nwhen we implement the trait on a type:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-03-default-impl-calls-other-methods/src/lib.rs:impl}}\n```\n\nAfter we define `summarize_author`, we can call `summarize` on instances of the\n`SocialPost` struct, and the default implementation of `summarize` will call the\ndefinition of `summarize_author` that we\u2019ve provided. Because we\u2019ve implemented\n`summarize_author`, the `Summary` trait has given us the behavior of the\n`summarize` method without requiring us to write any more code.

This parameter accepts any type that implements the\nspecified trait. In the body of `notify`, we can call any methods on `item`\nthat come from the `Summary` trait, such as `summarize`. We can call `notify`\nand pass in any instance of `NewsArticle` or `SocialPost`. Code that calls the\nfunction with any other type, such as a `String` or an `i32`, won\u2019t compile,\nbecause those types don\u2019t implement `Summary`.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds\"></a>\n\n#### Trait Bound Syntax\n\nThe `impl Trait` syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax\nsugar for a longer form known as a _trait bound_; it looks like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {\n    println!(\"Breaking news! {}\", item.summarize());\n}\n```\n\nThis longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is\nmore verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type\nparameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.\n\nThe `impl Trait` syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple\ncases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other\ncases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement `Summary`. Doing\nso with the `impl Trait` syntax looks like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {\n```\n\nUsing `impl Trait` is appropriate if we want this function to allow `item1` and\n`item2` to have different types (as long as both types implement `Summary`). If\nwe want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use a\ntrait bound, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {\n```\n\nThe generic type `T` specified as the type of the `item1` and `item2`\nparameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value\npassed as an argument for `item1` and `item2` must be the same.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax\"></a>\n\n#### Multiple Trait Bounds with the `+` Syntax\n\nWe can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted `notify` to use\ndisplay formatting as well as `summarize` on `item`: We specify in the `notify`\ndefinition that `item` must implement both `Display` and `Summary`. We can do\nso using the `+` syntax:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {\n```\n\nThe `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {\n```\n\nWith the two trait bounds specified, the body of `notify` can call `summarize`\nand use `{}` to format `item`.\n\n#### Clearer Trait Bounds with `where` Clauses\n\nUsing too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait\nbounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of\ntrait bound information between the function\u2019s name and its parameter list,\nmaking the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate\nsyntax for specifying trait bounds inside a `where` clause after the function\nsignature. So, instead of writing this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {\n```\n\nwe can use a `where` clause, like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-07-where-clause/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis function\u2019s signature is less cluttered: The function name, parameter list,\nand return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait\nbounds.",

But\nin the next `impl` block, `Pair<T>` only implements the `cmp_display` method if\nits inner type `T` implements the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparison\n_and_ the `Display` trait that enables printing.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-15\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Conditionally implementing methods on a generic type depending on trait bounds\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-15/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements\nanother trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait\nbounds are called _blanket implementations_ and are used extensively in the\nRust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the\n`ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. The `impl`\nblock in the standard library looks similar to this code:\n\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T: Display> ToString for T {\n    // --snip--\n}\n```\n\nBecause the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the\n`to_string` method defined by the `ToString` trait on any type that implements\nthe `Display` trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding\n`String` values like this because integers implement `Display`:\n\n```rust\nlet s = 3.to_string();\n```\n\nBlanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the\n\u201cImplementors\u201d section.\n\nTraits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to\nreduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic\ntype to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound\ninformation to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the\ncorrect behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at\nruntime if we called a method on a type that didn\u2019t define the method. But Rust\nmoves these errors to compile time so that we\u2019re forced to fix the problems\nbefore our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don\u2019t have to write code\nthat checks for behavior at runtime, because we\u2019ve already checked at compile\ntime.

Rather\nthan ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that\nreferences are valid as long as we need them to be.\n\nOne detail we didn\u2019t discuss in the [\u201cReferences and\nBorrowing\u201d][references-and-borrowing]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 is\nthat every reference in Rust has a lifetime, which is the scope for which\nthat reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred,\njust like most of the time, types are inferred. We are only required to\nannotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must\nannotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few\ndifferent ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic\nlifetime parameters to ensure that the actual references used at runtime will\ndefinitely be valid.\n\nAnnotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages\nhave, so this is going to feel unfamiliar. Although we won\u2019t cover lifetimes in\ntheir entirety in this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss common ways you might encounter\nlifetime syntax so that you can get comfortable with the concept.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Rather,\nthey describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each\nother without affecting the lifetimes.

Most people use the name `'a` for the first\nlifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the `&` of a\nreference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference\u2019s type.\n\nHere are some examples\u2014a reference to an `i32` without a lifetime parameter, a\nreference to an `i32` that has a lifetime parameter named `'a`, and a mutable\nreference to an `i32` that also has the lifetime `'a`:\n\n```rust,ignore\n&i32        // a reference\n&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime\n&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime\n```\n\nOne lifetime annotation by itself doesn\u2019t have much meaning, because the\nannotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple\nreferences relate to each other.

This is\nthe relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value.\nWe\u2019ll name the lifetime `'a` and then add it to each reference, as shown in\nListing 10-21.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-21\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The `longest` function definition specifying that all the references in the signature must have the same lifetime `'a`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-21/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the\n`main` function in Listing 10-19.\n\nThe function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime `'a`, the function\ntakes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as\nlong as lifetime `'a`. The function signature also tells Rust that the string\nslice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime `'a`.\nIn practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the\n`longest` function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values\nreferred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want\nRust to use when analyzing this code.\n\nRemember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature,\nwe\u2019re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather,\nwe\u2019re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don\u2019t\nadhere to these constraints. Note that the `longest` function doesn\u2019t need to\nknow exactly how long `x` and `y` will live, only that some scope can be\nsubstituted for `'a` that will satisfy this signature.\n\nWhen annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function\nsignature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of\nthe contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having\nfunction signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust\ncompiler does can be simpler. If there\u2019s a problem with the way a function is\nannotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of\nour code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler\nmade more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes\nto be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps\naway from the cause of the problem.\n\nWhen we pass concrete references to `longest`, the concrete lifetime that is\nsubstituted for `'a` is the part of the scope of `x` that overlaps with the\nscope of `y`. In other words, the generic lifetime `'a` will get the concrete\nlifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`. Because\nwe\u2019ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter `'a`,\nthe returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the\nlifetimes of `x` and `y`.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the `longest` function by\npassing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-22 is\na straightforward example.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-22\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using the `longest` function with references to `String` values that have different concrete lifetimes\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-22/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn this example, `string1` is valid until the end of the outer scope, `string2`\nis valid until the end of the inner scope, and `result` references something\nthat is valid until the end of the inner scope. Run this code and you\u2019ll see\nthat the borrow checker approves; it will compile and print `The longest string\nis long string is long`.\n\nNext, let\u2019s try an example that shows that the lifetime of the reference in\n`result` must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We\u2019ll move the\ndeclaration of the `result` variable outside the inner scope but leave the\nassignment of the value to the `result` variable inside the scope with\n`string2`. Then, we\u2019ll move the `println!` that uses `result` to outside the\ninner scope, after the inner scope has ended.

For example, if we changed the implementation of the\n`longest` function to always return the first parameter rather than the longest\nstring slice, we wouldn\u2019t need to specify a lifetime on the `y` parameter. The\nfollowing code will compile:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-08-only-one-reference-with-lifetime/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve specified a lifetime parameter `'a` for the parameter `x` and the return\ntype, but not for the parameter `y`, because the lifetime of `y` does not have\nany relationship with the lifetime of `x` or the return value.\n\nWhen returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the\nreturn type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If\nthe reference returned does _not_ refer to one of the parameters, it must refer\nto a value created within this function. However, this would be a dangling\nreference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function.\nConsider this attempted implementation of the `longest` function that won\u2019t\ncompile:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-09-unrelated-lifetime/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, even though we\u2019ve specified a lifetime parameter `'a` for the return\ntype, this implementation will fail to compile because the return value\nlifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameters at all. Here is the\nerror message we get:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-09-unrelated-lifetime/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe problem is that `result` goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end\nof the `longest` function. We\u2019re also trying to return a reference to `result`\nfrom the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that\nwould change the dangling reference, and Rust won\u2019t let us create a dangling\nreference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type\nrather than a reference so that the calling function is then responsible for\ncleaning up the value.\n\nUltimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various\nparameters and return values of functions. Once they\u2019re connected, Rust has\nenough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that\nwould create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

However, we\nhad a function in Listing 4-9, shown again in Listing 10-25, that compiled\nwithout lifetime annotations.\n\n<Listing number=\"10-25\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A function we defined in Listing 4-9 that compiled without lifetime annotations, even though the parameter and return type are references\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-25/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical:\nIn early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn\u2019t have compiled, because\nevery reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function\nsignature would have been written like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {\n```\n\nAfter writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers\nwere entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular\nsituations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic\npatterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler\u2019s code so\nthat the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and\nwouldn\u2019t need explicit annotations.\n\nThis piece of Rust history is relevant because it\u2019s possible that more\ndeterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,\neven fewer lifetime annotations might be required.\n\nThe patterns programmed into Rust\u2019s analysis of references are called the\n_lifetime elision rules_. These aren\u2019t rules for programmers to follow; they\u2019re\na set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code\nfits these cases, you don\u2019t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.\n\nThe elision rules don\u2019t provide full inference. If there is still ambiguity\nabout what lifetimes the references have after Rust applies the rules, the\ncompiler won\u2019t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be.\nInstead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve\nby adding the lifetime annotations.\n\nLifetimes on function or method parameters are called _input lifetimes_, and\nlifetimes on return values are called _output lifetimes_.\n\nThe compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references\nwhen there aren\u2019t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input\nlifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the\ncompiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for\nwhich it can\u2019t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.\nThese rules apply to `fn` definitions as well as `impl` blocks.\n\nThe first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each\nparameter that\u2019s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter\ngets one lifetime parameter: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)`; a function with two\nparameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32,\ny: &'b i32)`; and so on.\n\nThe second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that\nlifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)\n-> &'a i32`.\n\nThe third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but\none of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of\n`self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes\nmethods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.\n\nLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re the compiler. We\u2019ll apply these rules to figure out the\nlifetimes of the references in the signature of the `first_word` function in\nListing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the\nreferences:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {\n```\n\nThen, the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter\ngets its own lifetime. We\u2019ll call it `'a` as usual, so now the signature is\nthis:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {\n```\n\nThe second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second\nrule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to\nthe output lifetime, so the signature is now this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {\n```\n\nNow all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the\ncompiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate\nthe lifetimes in this function signature.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example, this time using the `longest` function that had\nno lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {\n```\n\nLet\u2019s apply the first rule: Each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we\nhave two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {\n```\n\nYou can see that the second rule doesn\u2019t apply, because there is more than one\ninput lifetime. The third rule doesn\u2019t apply either, because `longest` is a\nfunction rather than a method, so none of the parameters are `self`. After\nworking through all three rules, we still haven\u2019t figured out what the return\ntype\u2019s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in\nListing 10-20: The compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still\ncouldn\u2019t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.\n\nBecause the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we\u2019ll look at\nlifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don\u2019t have to\nannotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is `'static`.\n\nYou might see suggestions in error messages to use the `'static` lifetime.

This extra parameter will be printed\nusing `{}`, which is why the `Display` trait bound is necessary. Because\nlifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter\n`'a` and the generic type parameter `T` go in the same list inside the angle\nbrackets after the function name.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type\nparameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you\u2019re\nready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations.\nGeneric type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Traits and\ntrait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they\u2019ll have the\nbehavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure\nthat this flexible code won\u2019t have any dangling references. And all of this\nanalysis happens at compile time, which doesn\u2019t affect runtime performance!\n\nBelieve it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in\nthis chapter: Chapter 18 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use\ntraits. There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations\nthat you will only need in very advanced scenarios; for those, you should read\nthe [Rust Reference][reference].

Dijkstra said that \u201cprogram\ntesting can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is\nhopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t\ntry to test as much as we can!\n\n_Correctness_ in our programs is the extent to which our code does what we\nintend it to do. Rust is designed with a high degree of concern about the\ncorrectness of programs, but correctness is complex and not easy to prove.\nRust\u2019s type system shoulders a huge part of this burden, but the type system\ncannot catch everything. As such, Rust includes support for writing automated\nsoftware tests.\n\nSay we write a function `add_two` that adds 2 to whatever number is passed to\nit. This function\u2019s signature accepts an integer as a parameter and returns an\ninteger as a result. When we implement and compile that function, Rust does all\nthe type checking and borrow checking that you\u2019ve learned so far to ensure\nthat, for instance, we aren\u2019t passing a `String` value or an invalid reference\nto this function. But Rust _can\u2019t_ check that this function will do precisely\nwhat we intend, which is return the parameter plus 2 rather than, say, the\nparameter plus 10 or the parameter minus 50! That\u2019s where tests come in.\n\nWe can write tests that assert, for example, that when we pass `3` to the\n`add_two` function, the returned value is `5`. We can run these tests whenever\nwe make changes to our code to make sure any existing correct behavior has not\nchanged.\n\nTesting is a complex skill: Although we can\u2019t cover in one chapter every detail\nabout how to write good tests, in this chapter we will discuss the mechanics of\nRust\u2019s testing facilities. We\u2019ll talk about the annotations and macros\navailable to you when writing your tests, the default behavior and options\nprovided for running your tests, and how to organize tests into unit tests and\nintegration tests.",

Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is\nthe `derive` attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function\ninto a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`. When you run your\ntests with the `cargo test` command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs\nthe annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or\nfails.\n\nWhenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test\nfunction in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a\ntemplate for writing your tests so that you don\u2019t have to look up the exact\nstructure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many\nadditional test functions and as many test modules as you want!\n\nWe\u2019ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template\ntest before we actually test any code. Then, we\u2019ll write some real-world tests\nthat call some code that we\u2019ve written and assert that its behavior is correct.\n\nLet\u2019s create a new library project called `adder` that will add two numbers:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new adder --lib\n     Created library `adder` project\n$ cd adder\n```\n\nThe contents of the _src/lib.rs_ file in your `adder` library should look like\nListing 11-1.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-1\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"The code generated automatically by `cargo new`\">\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests\nrm -rf listing-11-01\ncargo new listing-11-01 --lib --name adder\ncd listing-11-01\necho \"$ cargo test\" > output.txt\nRUSTFLAGS=\"-A unused_variables -A dead_code\" RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test >> output.txt 2>&1\ngit diff output.txt # commit any relevant changes; discard irrelevant ones\ncd ../../..\n-->\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-01/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe file starts with an example `add` function so that we have something to\ntest.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s focus solely on the `it_works` function. Note the `#[test]`\nannotation: This attribute indicates this is a test function, so the test\nrunner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test\nfunctions in the `tests` module to help set up common scenarios or perform\ncommon operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.\n\nThe example function body uses the `assert_eq!` macro to assert that `result`,\nwhich contains the result of calling `add` with 2 and 2, equals 4. This\nassertion serves as an example of the format for a typical test. Let\u2019s run it\nto see that this test passes.\n\nThe `cargo test` command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing\n11-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-2\" caption=\"The output from running the automatically generated test\">\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-01/output.txt}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nCargo compiled and ran the test.

The overall summary `test\nresult: ok.` means that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads `1\npassed; 0 failed` totals the number of tests that passed or failed.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to mark a test as ignored so that it doesn\u2019t run in a particular\ninstance; we\u2019ll cover that in the [\u201cIgnoring Tests Unless Specifically\nRequested\u201d][ignoring]<!-- ignore --> section later in this chapter. Because we\nhaven\u2019t done that here, the summary shows `0 ignored`. We can also pass an\nargument to the `cargo test` command to run only tests whose name matches a\nstring; this is called _filtering_, and we\u2019ll cover it in the [\u201cRunning a\nSubset of Tests by Name\u201d][subset]<!-- ignore --> section. Here, we haven\u2019t\nfiltered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows `0 filtered out`.\n\nThe `0 measured` statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance.\nBenchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust.

For now, we\u2019ll\nignore the `Doc-tests` output.\n\nLet\u2019s start to customize the test to our own needs. First, change the name of\nthe `it_works` function to a different name, such as `exploration`, like so:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-01-changing-test-name/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nThen, run `cargo test` again. The output now shows `exploration` instead of\n`it_works`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-01-changing-test-name/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNow we\u2019ll add another test, but this time we\u2019ll make a test that fails! Tests\nfail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new\nthread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is\nmarked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic\nis to call the `panic!` macro. Enter the new test as a function named\n`another`, so your _src/lib.rs_ file looks like Listing 11-3.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-3\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding a second test that will fail because we call the `panic!` macro\">\n\n```rust,panics,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-03/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRun the tests again using `cargo test`. The output should look like Listing\n11-4, which shows that our `exploration` test passed and `another` failed.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-4\" caption=\"Test results when one test passes and one test fails\">\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-03/output.txt}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\nrg panicked listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-03/output.txt\ncheck the line number of the panic matches the line number in the following paragraph\n -->\n\nInstead of `ok`, the line `test tests::another` shows `FAILED`. Two new\nsections appear between the individual results and the summary: The first\ndisplays the detailed reason for each test failure. In this case, we get the\ndetails that `tests::another` failed because it panicked with the message `Make\nthis test fail` on line 17 in the _src/lib.rs_ file. The next section lists\njust the names of all the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of\ntests and lots of detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a\nfailing test to run just that test to debug it more easily; we\u2019ll talk more\nabout ways to run tests in the [\u201cControlling How Tests Are\nRun\u201d][controlling-how-tests-are-run]<!-- ignore --> section.\n\nThe summary line displays at the end: Overall, our test result is `FAILED`. We\nhad one test pass and one test fail.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios,\nlet\u2019s look at some macros other than `panic!` that are useful in tests.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "The `assert!` macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want\nto ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to `true`. We give the\n`assert!` macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is\n`true`, nothing happens and the test passes. If the value is `false`, the\n`assert!` macro calls `panic!` to cause the test to fail. Using the `assert!`\nmacro helps us check that our code is functioning in the way we intend.\n\nIn Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a `Rectangle` struct and a `can_hold`\nmethod, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let\u2019s put this code in the\n_src/lib.rs_ file, then write some tests for it using the `assert!` macro.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-5\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"The `Rectangle` struct and its `can_hold` method from Chapter 5\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-05/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `can_hold` method returns a Boolean, which means it\u2019s a perfect use case\nfor the `assert!` macro. In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the\n`can_hold` method by creating a `Rectangle` instance that has a width of 8 and\na height of 7 and asserting that it can hold another `Rectangle` instance that\nhas a width of 5 and a height of 1.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-6\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A test for `can_hold` that checks whether a larger rectangle can indeed hold a smaller rectangle\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-06/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote the `use super::*;` line inside the `tests` module. The `tests` module is\na regular module that follows the usual visibility rules we covered in Chapter\n7 in the [\u201cPaths for Referring to an Item in the Module\nTree\u201d][paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree]<!-- ignore -->\nsection. Because the `tests` module is an inner module, we need to bring the\ncode under test in the outer module into the scope of the inner module. We use\na glob here, so anything we define in the outer module is available to this\n`tests` module.\n\nWe\u2019ve named our test `larger_can_hold_smaller`, and we\u2019ve created the two\n`Rectangle` instances that we need. Then, we called the `assert!` macro and\npassed it the result of calling `larger.can_hold(&smaller)`. This expression is\nsupposed to return `true`, so our test should pass. Let\u2019s find out!\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-06/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIt does pass! Let\u2019s add another test, this time asserting that a smaller\nrectangle cannot hold a larger rectangle:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-02-adding-another-rectangle-test/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nBecause the correct result of the `can_hold` function in this case is `false`,\nwe need to negate that result before we pass it to the `assert!` macro. As a\nresult, our test will pass if `can_hold` returns `false`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-02-adding-another-rectangle-test/output.txt}}\n```\n\nTwo tests that pass! Now let\u2019s see what happens to our test results when we\nintroduce a bug in our code. We\u2019ll change the implementation of the `can_hold`\nmethod by replacing the greater-than sign (`>`) with a less-than sign (`<`)\nwhen it compares the widths:\n\n```rust,not_desired_behavior,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-03-introducing-a-bug/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nRunning the tests now produces the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-03-introducing-a-bug/output.txt}}\n```\n\nOur tests caught the bug! Because `larger.width` is `8` and `smaller.width` is\n`5`, the comparison of the widths in `can_hold` now returns `false`: 8 is not\nless than 5.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "A common way to verify functionality is to test for equality between the result\nof the code under test and the value you expect the code to return. You could\ndo this by using the `assert!` macro and passing it an expression using the\n`==` operator. However, this is such a common test that the standard library\nprovides a pair of macros\u2014`assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!`\u2014to perform this test\nmore conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or\ninequality, respectively. They\u2019ll also print the two values if the assertion\nfails, which makes it easier to see _why_ the test failed; conversely, the\n`assert!` macro only indicates that it got a `false` value for the `==`\nexpression, without printing the values that led to the `false` value.\n\nIn Listing 11-7, we write a function named `add_two` that adds `2` to its\nparameter, and then we test this function using the `assert_eq!` macro.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-7\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Testing the function `add_two` using the `assert_eq!` macro\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-07/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s check that it passes!\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-07/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWe create a variable named `result` that holds the result of calling\n`add_two(2)`. Then, we pass `result` and `4` as the arguments to the\n`assert_eq!` macro. The output line for this test is `test tests::it_adds_two\n... ok`, and the `ok` text indicates that our test passed!\n\nLet\u2019s introduce a bug into our code to see what `assert_eq!` looks like when it\nfails. Change the implementation of the `add_two` function to instead add `3`:\n\n```rust,not_desired_behavior,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-04-bug-in-add-two/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nRun the tests again:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-04-bug-in-add-two/output.txt}}\n```\n\nOur test caught the bug! The `tests::it_adds_two` test failed, and the message\ntells us that the assertion that failed was `left == right` and what the `left`\nand `right` values are. This message helps us start debugging: The `left`\nargument, where we had the result of calling `add_two(2)`, was `5`, but the\n`right` argument was `4`. You can imagine that this would be especially helpful\nwhen we have a lot of tests going on.\n\nNote that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality\nassertion functions are called `expected` and `actual`, and the order in which\nwe specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they\u2019re called `left` and\n`right`, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value\nthe code produces doesn\u2019t matter. We could write the assertion in this test as\n`assert_eq!(4, result)`, which would result in the same failure message that\ndisplays `` assertion `left == right` failed ``.\n\nThe `assert_ne!` macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and\nwill fail if they are equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we\u2019re not\nsure what a value _will_ be, but we know what the value definitely _shouldn\u2019t_\nbe. For example, if we\u2019re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its\ninput in some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day\nof the week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the\noutput of the function is not equal to the input.\n\nUnder the surface, the `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` macros use the operators\n`==` and `!=`, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their\narguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must\nimplement the `PartialEq` and `Debug` traits. All primitive types and most of\nthe standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that\nyou define yourself, you\u2019ll need to implement `PartialEq` to assert equality of\nthose types. You\u2019ll also need to implement `Debug` to print the values when the\nassertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in\nListing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the\n`#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]` annotation to your struct or enum definition. See\nAppendix C, [\u201cDerivable Traits,\u201d][derivable-traits]<!-- ignore --> for more\ndetails about these and other derivable traits.",

Custom messages are useful\nfor documenting what an assertion means; when a test fails, you\u2019ll have a better\nidea of what the problem is with the code.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we have a function that greets people by name and we\nwant to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-05-greeter/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nThe requirements for this program haven\u2019t been agreed upon yet, and we\u2019re\npretty sure the `Hello` text at the beginning of the greeting will change.

    "title": "Checking for Panics with `should_panic`",
    "content": "In addition to checking return values, it\u2019s important to check that our code\nhandles error conditions as we expect. For example, consider the `Guess` type\nthat we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13. Other code that uses `Guess`\ndepends on the guarantee that `Guess` instances will contain only values\nbetween 1 and 100. We can write a test that ensures that attempting to create a\n`Guess` instance with a value outside that range panics.\n\nWe do this by adding the attribute `should_panic` to our test function. The\ntest passes if the code inside the function panics; the test fails if the code\ninside the function doesn\u2019t panic.\n\nListing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of `Guess::new`\nhappen when we expect them to.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-8\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Testing that a condition will cause a `panic!`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-08/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe place the `#[should_panic]` attribute after the `#[test]` attribute and\nbefore the test function it applies to. Let\u2019s look at the result when this test\npasses:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-08/output.txt}}\n```\n\nLooks good! Now let\u2019s introduce a bug in our code by removing the condition\nthat the `new` function will panic if the value is greater than 100:\n\n```rust,not_desired_behavior,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-08-guess-with-bug/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWhen we run the test in Listing 11-8, it will fail:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-08-guess-with-bug/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWe don\u2019t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test\nfunction, we see that it\u2019s annotated with `#[should_panic]`. The failure we got\nmeans that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.\n\nTests that use `should_panic` can be imprecise. A `should_panic` test would\npass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one we were\nexpecting. To make `should_panic` tests more precise, we can add an optional\n`expected` parameter to the `should_panic` attribute. The test harness will\nmake sure that the failure message contains the provided text. For example,\nconsider the modified code for `Guess` in Listing 11-9 where the `new` function\npanics with different messages depending on whether the value is too small or\ntoo large.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-9\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Testing for a `panic!` with a panic message containing a specified substring\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-09/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis test will pass because the value we put in the `should_panic` attribute\u2019s\n`expected` parameter is a substring of the message that the `Guess::new`\nfunction panics with. We could have specified the entire panic message that we\nexpect, which in this case would be `Guess value must be less than or equal to\n100, got 200`. What you choose to specify depends on how much of the panic\nmessage is unique or dynamic and how precise you want your test to be. In this\ncase, a substring of the panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the\ntest function executes the `else if value > 100` case.\n\nTo see what happens when a `should_panic` test with an `expected` message\nfails, let\u2019s again introduce a bug into our code by swapping the bodies of the\n`if value < 1` and the `else if value > 100` blocks:\n\n```rust,ignore,not_desired_behavior\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-09-guess-with-panic-msg-bug/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis time when we run the `should_panic` test, it will fail:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-09-guess-with-panic-msg-bug/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected,\nbut the panic message did not include the expected string `less than or equal\nto 100`. The panic message that we did get in this case was `Guess value must\nbe greater than or equal to 1, got 200`. Now we can start figuring out where\nour bug is!",

One solution is to make sure each test writes to a\ndifferent file; another solution is to run the tests one at a time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained\ncontrol over the number of threads used, you can send the `--test-threads` flag\nand the number of threads you want to use to the test binary. Take a look at\nthe following example:\n\n```console\n$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1\n```\n\nWe set the number of test threads to `1`, telling the program not to use any\nparallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than running\nthem in parallel, but the tests won\u2019t interfere with each other if they share\nstate.",

The Rust community\nthinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration\ntests. _Unit tests_ are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation\nat a time, and can test private interfaces. _Integration tests_ are entirely\nexternal to your library and use your code in the same way any other external\ncode would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple\nmodules per test.\n\nWriting both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your\nlibrary are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.",

    "content": "The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the\nrest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn\u2019t working as\nexpected. You\u2019ll put unit tests in the _src_ directory in each file with the\ncode that they\u2019re testing. The convention is to create a module named `tests`\nin each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with\n`cfg(test)`.\n\n#### The `tests` Module and `#[cfg(test)]`\n\nThe `#[cfg(test)]` annotation on the `tests` module tells Rust to compile and\nrun the test code only when you run `cargo test`, not when you run `cargo\nbuild`. This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and\nsaves space in the resultant compiled artifact because the tests are not\nincluded. You\u2019ll see that because integration tests go in a different\ndirectory, they don\u2019t need the `#[cfg(test)]` annotation. However, because unit\ntests go in the same files as the code, you\u2019ll use `#[cfg(test)]` to specify\nthat they shouldn\u2019t be included in the compiled result.\n\nRecall that when we generated the new `adder` project in the first section of\nthis chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-01/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nOn the automatically generated `tests` module, the attribute `cfg` stands for\n_configuration_ and tells Rust that the following item should only be included\ngiven a certain configuration option. In this case, the configuration option is\n`test`, which is provided by Rust for compiling and running tests. By using the\n`cfg` attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only if we actively run the tests\nwith `cargo test`. This includes any helper functions that might be within this\nmodule, in addition to the functions annotated with `#[test]`.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"testing-private-functions\"></a>\n\n#### Private Function Tests\n\nThere\u2019s debate within the testing community about whether or not private\nfunctions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or\nimpossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you\nadhere to, Rust\u2019s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.\nConsider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function `internal_adder`.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-12\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Testing a private function\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-12/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that the `internal_adder` function is not marked as `pub`. Tests are just\nRust code, and the `tests` module is just another module. As we discussed in\n[\u201cPaths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree\u201d][paths]<!-- ignore -->,\nitems in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. In this\ntest, we bring all of the items belonging to the `tests` module\u2019s parent into\nscope with `use super::*`, and then the test can call `internal_adder`. If you\ndon\u2019t think private functions should be tested, there\u2019s nothing in Rust that\nwill compel you to do so.",

    "title": "Integration Tests",
    "content": "In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your\nlibrary in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call\nfunctions that are part of your library\u2019s public API. Their purpose is to test\nwhether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that\nwork correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test\ncoverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration\ntests, you first need a _tests_ directory.\n\n#### The _tests_ Directory\n\nWe create a _tests_ directory at the top level of our project directory, next\nto _src_. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We\ncan then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the\nfiles as an individual crate.\n\nLet\u2019s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the\n_src/lib.rs_ file, make a _tests_ directory, and create a new file named\n_tests/integration_test.rs_. Your directory structure should look like this:\n\n```text\nadder\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib.rs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tests\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 integration_test.rs\n```\n\nEnter the code in Listing 11-13 into the _tests/integration_test.rs_ file.\n\n<Listing number=\"11-13\" file-name=\"tests/integration_test.rs\" caption=\"An integration test of a function in the `adder` crate\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-13/tests/integration_test.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nEach file in the _tests_ directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our\nlibrary into each test crate\u2019s scope. For that reason, we add `use\nadder::add_two;` at the top of the code, which we didn\u2019t need in the unit tests.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to annotate any code in _tests/integration_test.rs_ with\n`#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo treats the _tests_ directory specially and compiles files\nin this directory only when we run `cargo test`. Run `cargo test` now:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-13/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and\nthe doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections\nwill not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won\u2019t be any output\nfor integration and doc tests, because those tests will only be run if all unit\ntests are passing.\n\nThe first section for the unit tests is the same as we\u2019ve been seeing: one line\nfor each unit test (one named `internal` that we added in Listing 11-12) and\nthen a summary line for the unit tests.\n\nThe integration tests section starts with the line `Running\ntests/integration_test.rs`. Next, there is a line for each test function in\nthat integration test and a summary line for the results of the integration\ntest just before the `Doc-tests adder` section starts.\n\nEach integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the\n_tests_ directory, there will be more integration test sections.\n\nWe can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test\nfunction\u2019s name as an argument to `cargo test`. To run all the tests in a\nparticular integration test file, use the `--test` argument of `cargo test`\nfollowed by the name of the file:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/output-only-05-single-integration/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis command runs only the tests in the _tests/integration_test.rs_ file.\n\n#### Submodules in Integration Tests\n\nAs you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the\n_tests_ directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test\nfunctions by the functionality they\u2019re testing. As mentioned earlier, each file\nin the _tests_ directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful\nfor creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users will be\nusing your crate. However, this means files in the _tests_ directory don\u2019t\nshare the same behavior as files in _src_ do, as you learned in Chapter 7\nregarding how to separate code into modules and files.\n\nThe different behavior of _tests_ directory files is most noticeable when you\nhave a set of helper functions to use in multiple integration test files, and\nyou try to follow the steps in the [\u201cSeparating Modules into Different\nFiles\u201d][separating-modules-into-files]<!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 7 to\nextract them into a common module. For example, if we create _tests/common.rs_\nand place a function named `setup` in it, we can add some code to `setup` that\nwe want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: tests/common.rs</span>\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-12-shared-test-code-problem/tests/common.rs}}\n```\n\nWhen we run the tests again, we\u2019ll see a new section in the test output for the\n_common.rs_ file, even though this file doesn\u2019t contain any test functions nor\ndid we call the `setup` function from anywhere:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-12-shared-test-code-problem/output.txt}}\n```\n\nHaving `common` appear in the test results with `running 0 tests` displayed for\nit is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other\nintegration test files. To avoid having `common` appear in the test output,\ninstead of creating _tests/common.rs_, we\u2019ll create _tests/common/mod.rs_. The\nproject directory now looks like this:\n\n```text\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib.rs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tests\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 common\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 mod.rs\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 integration_test.rs\n```\n\nThis is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we mentioned\nin [\u201cAlternate File Paths\u201d][alt-paths]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7. Naming the\nfile this way tells Rust not to treat the `common` module as an integration test\nfile. When we move the `setup` function code into _tests/common/mod.rs_ and\ndelete the _tests/common.rs_ file, the section in the test output will no longer\nappear. Files in subdirectories of the _tests_ directory don\u2019t get compiled as\nseparate crates or have sections in the test output.\n\nAfter we\u2019ve created _tests/common/mod.rs_, we can use it from any of the\nintegration test files as a module. Here\u2019s an example of calling the `setup`\nfunction from the `it_adds_two` test in _tests/integration_test.rs_:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-13-fix-shared-test-code-problem/tests/integration_test.rs}}\n```\n\nNote that the `mod common;` declaration is the same as the module declaration\nwe demonstrated in Listing 7-21. Then, in the test function, we can call the\n`common::setup()` function.\n\n#### Integration Tests for Binary Crates\n\nIf our project is a binary crate that only contains a _src/main.rs_ file and\ndoesn\u2019t have a _src/lib.rs_ file, we can\u2019t create integration tests in the\n_tests_ directory and bring functions defined in the _src/main.rs_ file into\nscope with a `use` statement. Only library crates expose functions that other\ncrates can use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.\n\nThis is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a\nstraightforward _src/main.rs_ file that calls logic that lives in the\n_src/lib.rs_ file. Using that structure, integration tests _can_ test the\nlibrary crate with `use` to make the important functionality available. If the\nimportant functionality works, the small amount of code in the _src/main.rs_\nfile will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn\u2019t need to be tested.\n\n## Summary\n\nRust\u2019s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to\nensure that it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit\ntests exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private\nimplementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library\nwork together correctly, and they use the library\u2019s public API to test the code\nin the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust\u2019s type system and\nownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to\nreduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.\n\nLet\u2019s combine the knowledge you learned in this chapter and in previous\nchapters to work on a project!\n\n[paths]: ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html\n[separating-modules-into-files]: ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html\n[alt-paths]: ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#alternate-file-paths",

We\u2019ll build a command line\ntool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice some of\nthe Rust concepts you now have under your belt.\n\nRust\u2019s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make it\nan ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our project, we\u2019ll\nmake our own version of the classic command line search tool `grep`\n(**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint). In the\nsimplest use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string. To\ndo so, `grep` takes as its arguments a file path and a string. Then, it reads\nthe file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints\nthose lines.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll show how to make our command line tool use the terminal\nfeatures that many other command line tools use. We\u2019ll read the value of an\nenvironment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our tool.\nWe\u2019ll also print error messages to the standard error console stream (`stderr`)\ninstead of standard output (`stdout`) so that, for example, the user can\nredirect successful output to a file while still seeing error messages onscreen.\n\nOne Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully\nfeatured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison, our\nversion will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some of the\nbackground knowledge you need to understand a real-world project such as\n`ripgrep`.\n\nOur `grep` project will combine a number of concepts you\u2019ve learned so far:\n\n- Organizing code ([Chapter 7][ch7]<!-- ignore -->)\n- Using vectors and strings ([Chapter 8][ch8]<!-- ignore -->)\n- Handling errors ([Chapter 9][ch9]<!-- ignore -->)\n- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate ([Chapter 10][ch10]<!-- ignore -->)\n- Writing tests ([Chapter 11][ch11]<!-- ignore -->)\n\nWe\u2019ll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which\n[Chapter 13][ch13]<!-- ignore --> and [Chapter 18][ch18]<!-- ignore --> will\ncover in detail.\n\n[ch7]: ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html\n[ch8]: ch08-00-common-collections.html\n[ch9]: ch09-00-error-handling.html\n[ch10]: ch10-00-generics.html\n[ch11]: ch11-00-testing.html\n[ch13]: ch13-00-functional-features.html\n[ch18]: ch18-00-oop.html",

    "content": "To enable `minigrep` to read the values of command line arguments we pass to\nit, we\u2019ll need the `std::env::args` function provided in Rust\u2019s standard\nlibrary. This function returns an iterator of the command line arguments passed\nto `minigrep`. We\u2019ll cover iterators fully in [Chapter 13][ch13]<!-- ignore\n-->. For now, you only need to know two details about iterators: Iterators\nproduce a series of values, and we can call the `collect` method on an iterator\nto turn it into a collection, such as a vector, which contains all the elements\nthe iterator produces.\n\nThe code in Listing 12-1 allows your `minigrep` program to read any command\nline arguments passed to it and then collect the values into a vector.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Collecting the command line arguments into a vector and printing them\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-01/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we bring the `std::env` module into scope with a `use` statement so that\nwe can use its `args` function. Notice that the `std::env::args` function is\nnested in two levels of modules. As we discussed in [Chapter\n7][ch7-idiomatic-use]<!-- ignore -->, in cases where the desired function is\nnested in more than one module, we\u2019ve chosen to bring the parent module into\nscope rather than the function. By doing so, we can easily use other functions\nfrom `std::env`. It\u2019s also less ambiguous than adding `use std::env::args` and\nthen calling the function with just `args`, because `args` might easily be\nmistaken for a function that\u2019s defined in the current module.\n\n> ### The `args` Function and Invalid Unicode\n>\n> Note that `std::env::args` will panic if any argument contains invalid\n> Unicode. If your program needs to accept arguments containing invalid\n> Unicode, use `std::env::args_os` instead. That function returns an iterator\n> that produces `OsString` values instead of `String` values. We\u2019ve chosen to\n> use `std::env::args` here for simplicity because `OsString` values differ per\n> platform and are more complex to work with than `String` values.\n\nOn the first line of `main`, we call `env::args`, and we immediately use\n`collect` to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values produced\nby the iterator. We can use the `collect` function to create many kinds of\ncollections, so we explicitly annotate the type of `args` to specify that we\nwant a vector of strings. Although you very rarely need to annotate types in\nRust, `collect` is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust\nisn\u2019t able to infer the kind of collection you want.\n\nFinally, we print the vector using the debug macro. Let\u2019s try running the code\nfirst with no arguments and then with two arguments:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-01/output.txt}}\n```\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/output-only-01-with-args/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNotice that the first value in the vector is `\"target/debug/minigrep\"`, which\nis the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments list in\nC, letting programs use the name by which they were invoked in their execution.\nIt\u2019s often convenient to have access to the program name in case you want to\nprint it in messages or change the behavior of the program based on what\ncommand line alias was used to invoke the program. But for the purposes of this\nchapter, we\u2019ll ignore it and save only the two arguments we need.",

    "content": "## Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling\n\nTo improve our program, we\u2019ll fix four problems that have to do with the\nprogram\u2019s structure and how it\u2019s handling potential errors. First, our `main`\nfunction now performs two tasks: It parses arguments and reads files. As our\nprogram grows, the number of separate tasks the `main` function handles will\nincrease. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to\nreason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its\nparts. It\u2019s best to separate functionality so that each function is responsible\nfor one task.\n\nThis issue also ties into the second problem: Although `query` and `file_path`\nare configuration variables to our program, variables like `contents` are used\nto perform the program\u2019s logic. The longer `main` becomes, the more variables\nwe\u2019ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder\nit will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It\u2019s best to group the\nconfiguration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.\n\nThe third problem is that we\u2019ve used `expect` to print an error message when\nreading the file fails, but the error message just prints `Should have been\nable to read the file`. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: For\nexample, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it.\nRight now, regardless of the situation, we\u2019d print the same error message for\neverything, which wouldn\u2019t give the user any information!\n\nFourth, we use `expect` to handle an error, and if the user runs our program\nwithout specifying enough arguments, they\u2019ll get an `index out of bounds` error\nfrom Rust that doesn\u2019t clearly explain the problem. It would be best if all the\nerror-handling code were in one place so that future maintainers had only one\nplace to consult the code if the error-handling logic needed to change. Having\nall the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that we\u2019re printing\nmessages that will be meaningful to our end users.\n\nLet\u2019s address these four problems by refactoring our project.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Separating Concerns in Binary Projects",
    "content": "The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to\nthe `main` function is common to many binary projects. As a result, many Rust\nprogrammers find it useful to split up the separate concerns of a binary\nprogram when the `main` function starts getting large. This process has the\nfollowing steps:\n\n- Split your program into a _main.rs_ file and a _lib.rs_ file and move your\n  program\u2019s logic to _lib.rs_.\n- As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in\n  the `main` function.\n- When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it\n  from the `main` function into other functions or types.\n\nThe responsibilities that remain in the `main` function after this process\nshould be limited to the following:\n\n- Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values\n- Setting up any other configuration\n- Calling a `run` function in _lib.rs_\n- Handling the error if `run` returns an error\n\nThis pattern is about separating concerns: _main.rs_ handles running the\nprogram and _lib.rs_ handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you\ncan\u2019t test the `main` function directly, this structure lets you test all of\nyour program\u2019s logic by moving it out of the `main` function. The code that\nremains in the `main` function will be small enough to verify its correctness\nby reading it. Let\u2019s rework our program by following this process.\n\n#### Extracting the Argument Parser\n\nWe\u2019ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that\n`main` will call. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of the `main` function that\ncalls a new function `parse_config`, which we\u2019ll define in _src/main.rs_.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-5\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Extracting a `parse_config` function from `main`\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-05/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of\nassigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable `query` and the\nargument value at index 2 to the variable `file_path` within the `main`\nfunction, we pass the whole vector to the `parse_config` function. The\n`parse_config` function then holds the logic that determines which argument\ngoes in which variable and passes the values back to `main`. We still create\nthe `query` and `file_path` variables in `main`, but `main` no longer has the\nresponsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables\ncorrespond.\n\nThis rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we\u2019re refactoring\nin small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to\nverify that the argument parsing still works. It\u2019s good to check your progress\noften, to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.\n\n#### Grouping Configuration Values\n\nWe can take another small step to improve the `parse_config` function further.\nAt the moment, we\u2019re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that\ntuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don\u2019t have\nthe right abstraction yet.\n\nAnother indicator that shows there\u2019s room for improvement is the `config` part\nof `parse_config`, which implies that the two values we return are related and\nare both part of one configuration value. We\u2019re not currently conveying this\nmeaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into\na tuple; we\u2019ll instead put the two values into one struct and give each of the\nstruct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future\nmaintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each\nother and what their purpose is.\n\nListing 12-6 shows the improvements to the `parse_config` function.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Refactoring `parse_config` to return an instance of a `Config` struct\">\n\n```rust,should_panic,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve added a struct named `Config` defined to have fields named `query` and\n`file_path`. The signature of `parse_config` now indicates that it returns a\n`Config` value. In the body of `parse_config`, where we used to return\nstring slices that reference `String` values in `args`, we now define `Config`\nto contain owned `String` values. The `args` variable in `main` is the owner of\nthe argument values and is only letting the `parse_config` function borrow\nthem, which means we\u2019d violate Rust\u2019s borrowing rules if `Config` tried to take\nownership of the values in `args`.\n\nThere are a number of ways we could manage the `String` data; the easiest,\nthough somewhat inefficient, route is to call the `clone` method on the values.\nThis will make a full copy of the data for the `Config` instance to own, which\ntakes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data.\nHowever, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we\ndon\u2019t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance,\ngiving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.\n\n> ### The Trade-Offs of Using `clone`\n>\n> There\u2019s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using `clone` to fix\n> ownership problems because of its runtime cost. In\n> [Chapter 13][ch13]<!-- ignore -->, you\u2019ll learn how to use more efficient\n> methods in this type of situation. But for now, it\u2019s okay to copy a few\n> strings to continue making progress because you\u2019ll make these copies only\n> once and your file path and query string are very small. It\u2019s better to have\n> a working program that\u2019s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize code\n> on your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it\u2019ll be\n> easier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it\u2019s\n> perfectly acceptable to call `clone`.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated `main` so that it places the instance of `Config` returned by\n`parse_config` into a variable named `config`, and we updated the code that\npreviously used the separate `query` and `file_path` variables so that it now\nuses the fields on the `Config` struct instead.\n\nNow our code more clearly conveys that `query` and `file_path` are related and\nthat their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that\nuses these values knows to find them in the `config` instance in the fields\nnamed for their purpose.\n\n#### Creating a Constructor for `Config`\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line\narguments from `main` and placed it in the `parse_config` function. Doing so\nhelped us see that the `query` and `file_path` values were related, and that\nrelationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a `Config` struct to\nname the related purpose of `query` and `file_path` and to be able to return the\nvalues\u2019 names as struct field names from the `parse_config` function.\n\nSo, now that the purpose of the `parse_config` function is to create a `Config`\ninstance, we can change `parse_config` from a plain function to a function\nnamed `new` that is associated with the `Config` struct. Making this change\nwill make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the\nstandard library, such as `String`, by calling `String::new`. Similarly, by\nchanging `parse_config` into a `new` function associated with `Config`, we\u2019ll\nbe able to create instances of `Config` by calling `Config::new`. Listing 12-7\nshows the changes we need to make.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Changing `parse_config` into `Config::new`\">\n\n```rust,should_panic,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-07/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve updated `main` where we were calling `parse_config` to instead call\n`Config::new`. We\u2019ve changed the name of `parse_config` to `new` and moved it\nwithin an `impl` block, which associates the `new` function with `Config`. Try\ncompiling this code again to make sure it works.",

    "content": "Now we\u2019ll work on fixing our error handling. Recall that attempting to access\nthe values in the `args` vector at index 1 or index 2 will cause the program to\npanic if the vector contains fewer than three items. Try running the program\nwithout any arguments; it will look like this:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-07/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe line `index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1` is an error\nmessage intended for programmers. It won\u2019t help our end users understand what\nthey should do instead. Let\u2019s fix that now.\n\n#### Improving the Error Message\n\nIn Listing 12-8, we add a check in the `new` function that will verify that the\nslice is long enough before accessing index 1 and index 2. If the slice isn\u2019t\nlong enough, the program panics and displays a better error message.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Adding a check for the number of arguments\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code is similar to [the `Guess::new` function we wrote in Listing\n9-13][ch9-custom-types]<!-- ignore -->, where we called `panic!` when the\n`value` argument was out of the range of valid values. Instead of checking for\na range of values here, we\u2019re checking that the length of `args` is at least\n`3` and the rest of the function can operate under the assumption that this\ncondition has been met. If `args` has fewer than three items, this condition\nwill be `true`, and we call the `panic!` macro to end the program immediately.\n\nWith these extra few lines of code in `new`, let\u2019s run the program without any\narguments again to see what the error looks like now:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-08/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis output is better: We now have a reasonable error message. However, we also\nhave extraneous information we don\u2019t want to give to our users. Perhaps the\ntechnique we used in Listing 9-13 isn\u2019t the best one to use here: A call to\n`panic!` is more appropriate for a programming problem than a usage problem,\n[as discussed in Chapter 9][ch9-error-guidelines]<!-- ignore -->. Instead,\nwe\u2019ll use the other technique you learned about in Chapter 9\u2014[returning a\n`Result`][ch9-result]<!-- ignore --> that indicates either success or an error.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"returning-a-result-from-new-instead-of-calling-panic\"></a>\n\n#### Returning a `Result` Instead of Calling `panic!`\n\nWe can instead return a `Result` value that will contain a `Config` instance in\nthe successful case and will describe the problem in the error case. We\u2019re also\ngoing to change the function name from `new` to `build` because many\nprogrammers expect `new` functions to never fail. When `Config::build` is\ncommunicating to `main`, we can use the `Result` type to signal there was a\nproblem. Then, we can change `main` to convert an `Err` variant into a more\npractical error for our users without the surrounding text about `thread\n'main'` and `RUST_BACKTRACE` that a call to `panic!` causes.\n\nListing 12-9 shows the changes we need to make to the return value of the\nfunction we\u2019re now calling `Config::build` and the body of the function needed\nto return a `Result`. Note that this won\u2019t compile until we update `main` as\nwell, which we\u2019ll do in the next listing.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-9\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Returning a `Result` from `Config::build`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-09/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOur `build` function returns a `Result` with a `Config` instance in the success\ncase and a string literal in the error case. Our error values will always be\nstring literals that have the `'static` lifetime.\n\nWe\u2019ve made two changes in the body of the function: Instead of calling `panic!`\nwhen the user doesn\u2019t pass enough arguments, we now return an `Err` value, and\nwe\u2019ve wrapped the `Config` return value in an `Ok`. These changes make the\nfunction conform to its new type signature.\n\nReturning an `Err` value from `Config::build` allows the `main` function to\nhandle the `Result` value returned from the `build` function and exit the\nprocess more cleanly in the error case.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"calling-confignew-and-handling-errors\"></a>\n\n#### Calling `Config::build` and Handling Errors\n\nTo handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to update\n`main` to handle the `Result` being returned by `Config::build`, as shown in\nListing 12-10. We\u2019ll also take the responsibility of exiting the command line\ntool with a nonzero error code away from `panic!` and instead implement it by\nhand. A nonzero exit status is a convention to signal to the process that\ncalled our program that the program exited with an error state.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Exiting with an error code if building a `Config` fails\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-10/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn this listing, we\u2019ve used a method we haven\u2019t covered in detail yet:\n`unwrap_or_else`, which is defined on `Result<T, E>` by the standard library.\nUsing `unwrap_or_else` allows us to define some custom, non-`panic!` error\nhandling. If the `Result` is an `Ok` value, this method\u2019s behavior is similar\nto `unwrap`: It returns the inner value that `Ok` is wrapping. However, if the\nvalue is an `Err` value, this method calls the code in the closure, which is\nan anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to `unwrap_or_else`.\nWe\u2019ll cover closures in more detail in [Chapter 13][ch13]<!-- ignore -->. For\nnow, you just need to know that `unwrap_or_else` will pass the inner value of\nthe `Err`, which in this case is the static string `\"not enough arguments\"`\nthat we added in Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument `err` that\nappears between the vertical pipes. The code in the closure can then use the\n`err` value when it runs.\n\nWe\u2019ve added a new `use` line to bring `process` from the standard library into\nscope. The code in the closure that will be run in the error case is only two\nlines: We print the `err` value and then call `process::exit`. The\n`process::exit` function will stop the program immediately and return the\nnumber that was passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the\n`panic!`-based handling we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the\nextra output. Let\u2019s try it:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-10/output.txt}}\n```\n\nGreat! This output is much friendlier for our users.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Now that we\u2019ve finished refactoring the configuration parsing, let\u2019s turn to\nthe program\u2019s logic. As we stated in [\u201cSeparating Concerns in Binary\nProjects\u201d](#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects)<!-- ignore -->, we\u2019ll\nextract a function named `run` that will hold all the logic currently in the\n`main` function that isn\u2019t involved with setting up configuration or handling\nerrors. When we\u2019re done, the `main` function will be concise and easy to verify\nby inspection, and we\u2019ll be able to write tests for all the other logic.\n\nListing 12-11 shows the small, incremental improvement of extracting a `run`\nfunction.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Extracting a `run` function containing the rest of the program logic\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `run` function now contains all the remaining logic from `main`, starting\nfrom reading the file. The `run` function takes the `Config` instance as an\nargument.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"returning-errors-from-the-run-function\"></a>\n\n#### Returning Errors from `run`\n\nWith the remaining program logic separated into the `run` function, we can\nimprove the error handling, as we did with `Config::build` in Listing 12-9.\nInstead of allowing the program to panic by calling `expect`, the `run`\nfunction will return a `Result<T, E>` when something goes wrong. This will let\nus further consolidate the logic around handling errors into `main` in a\nuser-friendly way. Listing 12-12 shows the changes we need to make to the\nsignature and body of `run`.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-12\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Changing the `run` function to return `Result`\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-12/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the return type of\nthe `run` function to `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>`. This function previously\nreturned the unit type, `()`, and we keep that as the value returned in the\n`Ok` case.\n\nFor the error type, we used the trait object `Box<dyn Error>` (and we brought\n`std::error::Error` into scope with a `use` statement at the top). We\u2019ll cover\ntrait objects in [Chapter 18][ch18]<!-- ignore -->. For now, just know that\n`Box<dyn Error>` means the function will return a type that implements the\n`Error` trait, but we don\u2019t have to specify what particular type the return\nvalue will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that may be of\ndifferent types in different error cases. The `dyn` keyword is short for\n_dynamic_.\n\nSecond, we\u2019ve removed the call to `expect` in favor of the `?` operator, as we\ntalked about in [Chapter 9][ch9-question-mark]<!-- ignore -->. Rather than\n`panic!` on an error, `?` will return the error value from the current function\nfor the caller to handle.\n\nThird, the `run` function now returns an `Ok` value in the success case.\nWe\u2019ve declared the `run` function\u2019s success type as `()` in the signature,\nwhich means we need to wrap the unit type value in the `Ok` value. This\n`Ok(())` syntax might look a bit strange at first. But using `()` like this is\nthe idiomatic way to indicate that we\u2019re calling `run` for its side effects\nonly; it doesn\u2019t return a value we need.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will compile but will display a warning:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-12/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust tells us that our code ignored the `Result` value and the `Result` value\nmight indicate that an error occurred. But we\u2019re not checking to see whether or\nnot there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that we probably meant to\nhave some error-handling code here! Let\u2019s rectify that problem now.\n\n#### Handling Errors Returned from `run` in `main`\n\nWe\u2019ll check for errors and handle them using a technique similar to one we used\nwith `Config::build` in Listing 12-10, but with a slight difference:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/no-listing-01-handling-errors-in-main/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe use `if let` rather than `unwrap_or_else` to check whether `run` returns an\n`Err` value and to call `process::exit(1)` if it does. The `run` function\ndoesn\u2019t return a value that we want to `unwrap` in the same way that\n`Config::build` returns the `Config` instance. Because `run` returns `()` in\nthe success case, we only care about detecting an error, so we don\u2019t need\n`unwrap_or_else` to return the unwrapped value, which would only be `()`.\n\nThe bodies of the `if let` and the `unwrap_or_else` functions are the same in\nboth cases: We print the error and exit.",

That way, we\ncan test the code and have a _src/main.rs_ file with fewer responsibilities.\n\nLet\u2019s define the code responsible for searching text in _src/lib.rs_ rather\nthan in _src/main.rs_, which will let us (or anyone else using our\n`minigrep` library) call the searching function from more contexts than our\n`minigrep` binary.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define the `search` function signature in _src/lib.rs_ as shown in\nListing 12-13, with a body that calls the `unimplemented!` macro. We\u2019ll explain\nthe signature in more detail when we fill in the implementation.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-13\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Defining the `search` function in *src/lib.rs*\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-13/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve used the `pub` keyword on the function definition to designate `search`\nas part of our library crate\u2019s public API. We now have a library crate that we\ncan use from our binary crate and that we can test!\n\nNow we need to bring the code defined in _src/lib.rs_ into the scope of the\nbinary crate in _src/main.rs_ and call it, as shown in Listing 12-14.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-14\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using the `minigrep` library crate\u2019s `search` function in *src/main.rs*\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-14/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe add a `use minigrep::search` line to bring the `search` function from\nthe library crate into the binary crate\u2019s scope. Then, in the `run` function,\nrather than printing out the contents of the file, we call the `search`\nfunction and pass the `config.query` value and `contents` as arguments. Then,\n`run` will use a `for` loop to print each line returned from `search` that\nmatched the query. This is also a good time to remove the `println!` calls in\nthe `main` function that displayed the query and the file path so that our\nprogram only prints the search results (if no errors occur).\n\nNote that the search function will be collecting all the results into a vector\nit returns before any printing happens. This implementation could be slow to\ndisplay results when searching large files, because results aren\u2019t printed as\nthey\u2019re found; we\u2019ll discuss a possible way to fix this using iterators in\nChapter 13.\n\nWhew! That was a lot of work, but we\u2019ve set ourselves up for success in the\nfuture. Now it\u2019s much easier to handle errors, and we\u2019ve made the code more\nmodular.

We can call functions directly with various arguments and check return\nvalues without having to call our binary from the command line.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll add the searching logic to the `minigrep` program using\nthe test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:\n\n1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you\n   expect.\n2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.\n3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue\n   to pass.\n4. Repeat from step 1!\n\nThough it\u2019s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code\ndesign. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass\nhelps maintain high test coverage throughout the process.\n\nWe\u2019ll test-drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do\nthe searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of\nlines that match the query.

    "content": "In _src/lib.rs_, we\u2019ll add a `tests` module with a test function, as we did in\n[Chapter 11][ch11-anatomy]<!-- ignore -->. The test function specifies the\nbehavior we want the `search` function to have: It will take a query and the\ntext to search, and it will return only the lines from the text that contain\nthe query. Listing 12-15 shows this test.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-15\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Creating a failing test for the `search` function for the functionality we wish we had\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-15/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis test searches for the string `\"duct\"`. The text we\u2019re searching is three\nlines, only one of which contains `\"duct\"` (note that the backslash after the\nopening double quote tells Rust not to put a newline character at the beginning\nof the contents of this string literal). We assert that the value returned from\nthe `search` function contains only the line we expect.\n\nIf we run this test, it will currently fail because the `unimplemented!` macro\npanics with the message \u201cnot implemented\u201d. In accordance with TDD principles,\nwe\u2019ll take a small step of adding just enough code to get the test to not panic\nwhen calling the function by defining the `search` function to always return an\nempty vector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Then, the test should compile and fail\nbecause an empty vector doesn\u2019t match a vector containing the line `\"safe,\nfast, productive.\"`.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-16\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Defining just enough of the `search` function so that calling it won\u2019t panic\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-16/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss why we need to define an explicit lifetime `'a` in the\nsignature of `search` and use that lifetime with the `contents` argument and\nthe return value. Recall in [Chapter 10][ch10-lifetimes]<!-- ignore --> that\nthe lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the\nlifetime of the return value. In this case, we indicate that the returned\nvector should contain string slices that reference slices of the argument\n`contents` (rather than the argument `query`).\n\nIn other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the `search` function\nwill live as long as the data passed into the `search` function in the\n`contents` argument. This is important! The data referenced _by_ a slice needs\nto be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we\u2019re making\nstring slices of `query` rather than `contents`, it will do its safety checking\nincorrectly.\n\nIf we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we\u2019ll\nget this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/output-only-02-missing-lifetimes/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust can\u2019t know which of the two parameters we need for the output, so we need\nto tell it explicitly. Note that the help text suggests specifying the same\nlifetime parameter for all the parameters and the output type, which is\nincorrect! Because `contents` is the parameter that contains all of our text\nand we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know `contents` is\nthe only parameter that should be connected to the return value using the\nlifetime syntax.\n\nOther programming languages don\u2019t require you to connect arguments to return\nvalues in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time. You might\nwant to compare this example with the examples in the [\u201cValidating References\nwith Lifetimes\u201d][validating-references-with-lifetimes]<!-- ignore --> section\nin Chapter 10.",

Iterate through each line of the contents.\n2. Check whether the line contains our query string.\n3. If it does, add it to the list of values we\u2019re returning.\n4. If it doesn\u2019t, do nothing.\n5. Return the list of results that match.\n\nLet\u2019s work through each step, starting with iterating through lines.\n\n#### Iterating Through Lines with the `lines` Method\n\nRust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings,\nconveniently named `lines`, that works as shown in Listing 12-17. Note that\nthis won\u2019t compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-17\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Iterating through each line in `contents`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-17/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `lines` method returns an iterator. We\u2019ll talk about iterators in depth in\n[Chapter 13][ch13-iterators]<!-- ignore -->. But recall that you saw this way\nof using an iterator in [Listing 3-5][ch3-iter]<!-- ignore -->, where we used a\n`for` loop with an iterator to run some code on each item in a collection.\n\n#### Searching Each Line for the Query\n\nNext, we\u2019ll check whether the current line contains our query string.\nFortunately, strings have a helpful method named `contains` that does this for\nus! Add a call to the `contains` method in the `search` function, as shown in\nListing 12-18. Note that this still won\u2019t compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-18\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding functionality to see whether the line contains the string in `query`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-18/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAt the moment, we\u2019re building up functionality. To get the code to compile, we\nneed to return a value from the body as we indicated we would in the function\nsignature.\n\n#### Storing Matching Lines\n\nTo finish this function, we need a way to store the matching lines that we want\nto return. For that, we can make a mutable vector before the `for` loop and\ncall the `push` method to store a `line` in the vector. After the `for` loop,\nwe return the vector, as shown in Listing 12-19.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-19\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Storing the lines that match so that we can return them\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-19/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNow the `search` function should return only the lines that contain `query`,\nand our test should pass. Let\u2019s run the test:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-19/output.txt}}\n```\n\nOur test passed, so we know it works!\n\nAt this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the\nimplementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to\nmaintain the same functionality. The code in the search function isn\u2019t too bad,\nbut it doesn\u2019t take advantage of some useful features of iterators. We\u2019ll\nreturn to this example in [Chapter 13][ch13-iterators]<!-- ignore -->, where\nwe\u2019ll explore iterators in detail, and look at how to improve it.\n\nNow the entire program should work! Let\u2019s try it out, first with a word that\nshould return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem: _frog_.\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/no-listing-02-using-search-in-run/output.txt}}\n```\n\nCool! Now let\u2019s try a word that will match multiple lines, like _body_:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/output-only-03-multiple-matches/output.txt}}\n```\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t get any lines when we search for a\nword that isn\u2019t anywhere in the poem, such as _monomorphization_:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/output-only-04-no-matches/output.txt}}\n```\n\nExcellent! We\u2019ve built our own mini version of a classic tool and learned a lot\nabout how to structure applications. We\u2019ve also learned a bit about file input\nand output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.\n\nTo round out this project, we\u2019ll briefly demonstrate how to work with\nenvironment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which are\nuseful when you\u2019re writing command line programs.\n\n[validating-references-with-lifetimes]: ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#validating-references-with-lifetimes\n[ch11-anatomy]: ch11-01-writing-tests.html#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function\n[ch10-lifetimes]: ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html\n[ch3-iter]: ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n[ch13-iterators]: ch13-02-iterators.html",

The only difference is that we\u2019ll lowercase\nthe `query` and each `line` so that whatever the case of the input arguments,\nthey\u2019ll be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-21\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Defining the `search_case_insensitive` function to lowercase the query and the line before comparing them\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-21/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we lowercase the `query` string and store it in a new variable with the\nsame name, shadowing the original `query`. Calling `to_lowercase` on the query\nis necessary so that no matter whether the user\u2019s query is `\"rust\"`, `\"RUST\"`,\n`\"Rust\"`, or `\"rUsT\"`, we\u2019ll treat the query as if it were `\"rust\"` and be\ninsensitive to the case. While `to_lowercase` will handle basic Unicode, it\nwon\u2019t be 100 percent accurate. If we were writing a real application, we\u2019d want\nto do a bit more work here, but this section is about environment variables,\nnot Unicode, so we\u2019ll leave it at that here.\n\nNote that `query` is now a `String` rather than a string slice because calling\n`to_lowercase` creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the\nquery is `\"rUsT\"`, as an example: That string slice doesn\u2019t contain a lowercase\n`u` or `t` for us to use, so we have to allocate a new `String` containing\n`\"rust\"`. When we pass `query` as an argument to the `contains` method now, we\nneed to add an ampersand because the signature of `contains` is defined to take\na string slice.\n\nNext, we add a call to `to_lowercase` on each `line` to lowercase all\ncharacters. Now that we\u2019ve converted `line` and `query` to lowercase, we\u2019ll\nfind matches no matter what the case of the query is.\n\nLet\u2019s see if this implementation passes the tests:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-21/output.txt}}\n```\n\nGreat! They passed. Now let\u2019s call the new `search_case_insensitive` function\nfrom the `run` function. First, we\u2019ll add a configuration option to the `Config`\nstruct to switch between case-sensitive and case-insensitive search. Adding\nthis field will cause compiler errors because we aren\u2019t initializing this field\nanywhere yet:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-22/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe added the `ignore_case` field that holds a Boolean. Next, we need the `run`\nfunction to check the `ignore_case` field\u2019s value and use that to decide\nwhether to call the `search` function or the `search_case_insensitive`\nfunction, as shown in Listing 12-22. This still won\u2019t compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-22\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Calling either `search` or `search_case_insensitive` based on the value in `config.ignore_case`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-22/src/main.rs:there}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFinally, we need to check for the environment variable. The functions for\nworking with environment variables are in the `env` module in the standard\nlibrary, which is already in scope at the top of _src/main.rs_. We\u2019ll use the\n`var` function from the `env` module to check to see if any value has been set\nfor an environment variable named `IGNORE_CASE`, as shown in Listing 12-23.\n\n<Listing number=\"12-23\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Checking for any value in an environment variable named `IGNORE_CASE`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-23/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we create a new variable, `ignore_case`. To set its value, we call the\n`env::var` function and pass it the name of the `IGNORE_CASE` environment\nvariable. The `env::var` function returns a `Result` that will be the\nsuccessful `Ok` variant that contains the value of the environment variable if\nthe environment variable is set to any value. It will return the `Err` variant\nif the environment variable is not set.\n\nWe\u2019re using the `is_ok` method on the `Result` to check whether the environment\nvariable is set, which means the program should do a case-insensitive search.\nIf the `IGNORE_CASE` environment variable isn\u2019t set to anything, `is_ok` will\nreturn `false` and the program will perform a case-sensitive search. We don\u2019t\ncare about the _value_ of the environment variable, just whether it\u2019s set or\nunset, so we\u2019re checking `is_ok` rather than using `unwrap`, `expect`, or any\nof the other methods we\u2019ve seen on `Result`.\n\nWe pass the value in the `ignore_case` variable to the `Config` instance so\nthat the `run` function can read that value and decide whether to call\n`search_case_insensitive` or `search`, as we implemented in Listing 12-22.\n\nLet\u2019s give it a try! First, we\u2019ll run our program without the environment\nvariable set and with the query `to`, which should match any line that contains\nthe word _to_ in all lowercase:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-23/output.txt}}\n```\n\nLooks like that still works! Now let\u2019s run the program with `IGNORE_CASE` set\nto `1` but with the same query `to`:\n\n```console\n$ IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable and\nrun the program as separate commands:\n\n```console\nPS> $Env:IGNORE_CASE=1; cargo run -- to poem.txt\n```\n\nThis will make `IGNORE_CASE` persist for the remainder of your shell session.\nIt can be unset with the `Remove-Item` cmdlet:\n\n```console\nPS> Remove-Item Env:IGNORE_CASE\n```\n\nWe should get lines that contain _to_ that might have uppercase letters:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-23\nIGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt\ncan't extract because of the environment variable\n-->\n\n```console\nAre you nobody, too?\nHow dreary to be somebody!\nTo tell your name the livelong day\nTo an admiring bog!\n```\n\nExcellent, we also got lines containing _To_! Our `minigrep` program can now do\ncase-insensitive searching controlled by an environment variable. Now you know\nhow to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment\nvariables.\n\nSome programs allow arguments _and_ environment variables for the same\nconfiguration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes\nprecedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case sensitivity\nthrough either a command line argument or an environment variable. Decide\nwhether the command line argument or the environment variable should take\nprecedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and one set to\nignore case.\n\nThe `std::env` module contains many more useful features for dealing with\nenvironment variables: Check out its documentation to see what is available.",

    "content": "We\u2019ll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the\nenvironment they\u2019re defined in for later use. Here\u2019s the scenario: Every so\noften, our T-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to\nsomeone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list can\noptionally add their favorite color to their profile. If the person chosen for\na free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt. If the\nperson hasn\u2019t specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company\ncurrently has the most of.\n\nThere are many ways to implement this. For this example, we\u2019re going to use an\nenum called `ShirtColor` that has the variants `Red` and `Blue` (limiting the\nnumber of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company\u2019s\ninventory with an `Inventory` struct that has a field named `shirts` that\ncontains a `Vec<ShirtColor>` representing the shirt colors currently in stock.\nThe method `giveaway` defined on `Inventory` gets the optional shirt color\npreference of the free-shirt winner, and it returns the shirt color the\nperson will get. This setup is shown in Listing 13-1.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Shirt company giveaway situation\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-01/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `store` defined in `main` has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining\nto distribute for this limited-edition promotion. We call the `giveaway` method\nfor a user with a preference for a red shirt and a user without any preference.\n\nAgain, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus on\nclosures, we\u2019ve stuck to concepts you\u2019ve already learned, except for the body of\nthe `giveaway` method that uses a closure. In the `giveaway` method, we get the\nuser preference as a parameter of type `Option<ShirtColor>` and call the\n`unwrap_or_else` method on `user_preference`. The [`unwrap_or_else` method on\n`Option<T>`][unwrap-or-else]<!-- ignore --> is defined by the standard library.\nIt takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value `T`\n(the same type stored in the `Some` variant of the `Option<T>`, in this case\n`ShirtColor`). If the `Option<T>` is the `Some` variant, `unwrap_or_else`\nreturns the value from within the `Some`. If the `Option<T>` is the `None`\nvariant, `unwrap_or_else` calls the closure and returns the value returned by\nthe closure.\n\nWe specify the closure expression `|| self.most_stocked()` as the argument to\n`unwrap_or_else`. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the\nclosure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical pipes). The\nbody of the closure calls `self.most_stocked()`. We\u2019re defining the closure\nhere, and the implementation of `unwrap_or_else` will evaluate the closure\nlater if the result is needed.\n\nRunning this code prints the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-01/output.txt}}\n```\n\nOne interesting aspect here is that we\u2019ve passed a closure that calls\n`self.most_stocked()` on the current `Inventory` instance. The standard library\ndidn\u2019t need to know anything about the `Inventory` or `ShirtColor` types we\ndefined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an\nimmutable reference to the `self` `Inventory` instance and passes it with the\ncode we specify to the `unwrap_or_else` method. Functions, on the other hand,\nare not able to capture their environment in this way.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Inferring and Annotating Closure Types",
    "content": "There are more differences between functions and closures. Closures don\u2019t\nusually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value\nlike `fn` functions do. Type annotations are required on functions because the\ntypes are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this\ninterface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types\nof values a function uses and returns. Closures, on the other hand, aren\u2019t used\nin an exposed interface like this: They\u2019re stored in variables, and they\u2019re\nused without naming them and exposing them to users of our library.\n\nClosures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather\nthan in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler can\ninfer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it\u2019s able\nto infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler\nneeds closure type annotations too).\n\nAs with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase\nexplicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly\nnecessary. Annotating the types for a closure would look like the definition\nshown in Listing 13-2. In this example, we\u2019re defining a closure and storing it\nin a variable rather than defining the closure in the spot we pass it as an\nargument, as we did in Listing 13-1.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Adding optional type annotations of the parameter and return value types in the closure\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWith type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar to the\nsyntax of functions. Here, we define a function that adds 1 to its parameter and\na closure that has the same behavior, for comparison. We\u2019ve added some spaces\nto line up the relevant parts. This illustrates how closure syntax is similar\nto function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is\noptional:\n\n```rust,ignore\nfn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }\nlet add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };\nlet add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };\nlet add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;\n```\n\nThe first line shows a function definition and the second line shows a fully\nannotated closure definition. In the third line, we remove the type annotations\nfrom the closure definition. In the fourth line, we remove the brackets, which\nare optional because the closure body has only one expression. These are all\nvalid definitions that will produce the same behavior when they\u2019re called. The\n`add_one_v3` and `add_one_v4` lines require the closures to be evaluated to be\nable to compile because the types will be inferred from their usage. This is\nsimilar to `let v = Vec::new();` needing either type annotations or values of\nsome type to be inserted into the `Vec` for Rust to be able to infer the type.\n\nFor closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of\ntheir parameters and for their return value. For instance, Listing 13-3 shows\nthe definition of a short closure that just returns the value it receives as a\nparameter. This closure isn\u2019t very useful except for the purposes of this\nexample. Note that we haven\u2019t added any type annotations to the definition.\nBecause there are no type annotations, we can call the closure with any type,\nwhich we\u2019ve done here with `String` the first time. If we then try to call\n`example_closure` with an integer, we\u2019ll get an error.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to call a closure whose types are inferred with two different types\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe compiler gives us this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-03/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe first time we call `example_closure` with the `String` value, the compiler\ninfers the type of `x` and the return type of the closure to be `String`.

    "content": "Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which\ndirectly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing\nimmutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closure will decide\nwhich of these to use based on what the body of the function does with the\ncaptured values.\n\nIn Listing 13-4, we define a closure that captures an immutable reference to\nthe vector named `list` because it only needs an immutable reference to print\nthe value.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Defining and calling a closure that captures an immutable reference\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-04/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis example also illustrates that a variable can bind to a closure definition,\nand we can later call the closure by using the variable name and parentheses as\nif the variable name were a function name.\n\nBecause we can have multiple immutable references to `list` at the same time,\n`list` is still accessible from the code before the closure definition, after\nthe closure definition but before the closure is called, and after the closure\nis called. This code compiles, runs, and prints:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-04/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNext, in Listing 13-5, we change the closure body so that it adds an element to\nthe `list` vector.

We don\u2019t use the closure again after the closure\nis called, so the mutable borrow ends. Between the closure definition and the\nclosure call, an immutable borrow to print isn\u2019t allowed, because no other\nborrows are allowed when there\u2019s a mutable borrow. Try adding a `println!`\nthere to see what error message you get!\n\nIf you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the\nenvironment even though the body of the closure doesn\u2019t strictly need\nownership, you can use the `move` keyword before the parameter list.\n\nThis technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move\nthe data so that it\u2019s owned by the new thread. We\u2019ll discuss threads and why\nyou would want to use them in detail in Chapter 16 when we talk about\nconcurrency, but for now, let\u2019s briefly explore spawning a new thread using a\nclosure that needs the `move` keyword. Listing 13-6 shows Listing 13-4 modified\nto print the vector in a new thread rather than in the main thread.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using `move` to force the closure for the thread to take ownership of `list`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-06/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe spawn a new thread, giving the thread a closure to run as an argument. The\nclosure body prints out the list. In Listing 13-4, the closure only captured\n`list` using an immutable reference because that's the least amount of access\nto `list` needed to print it. In this example, even though the closure body\nstill only needs an immutable reference, we need to specify that `list` should\nbe moved into the closure by putting the `move` keyword at the beginning of the\nclosure definition. If the main thread performed more operations before calling\n`join` on the new thread, the new thread might finish before the rest of the\nmain thread finishes, or the main thread might finish first. If the main thread\nmaintained ownership of `list` but ended before the new thread and drops\n`list`, the immutable reference in the thread would be invalid. Therefore, the\ncompiler requires that `list` be moved into the closure given to the new thread\nso that the reference will be valid. Try removing the `move` keyword or using\n`list` in the main thread after the closure is defined to see what compiler\nerrors you get!\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Once a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value from\nthe environment where the closure is defined (thus affecting what, if anything,\nis moved _into_ the closure), the code in the body of the closure defines what\nhappens to the references or values when the closure is evaluated later (thus\naffecting what, if anything, is moved _out of_ the closure).\n\nA closure body can do any of the following: Move a captured value out of the\nclosure, mutate the captured value, neither move nor mutate the value, or\ncapture nothing from the environment to begin with.\n\nThe way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects\nwhich traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs\ncan specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically\nimplement one, two, or all three of these `Fn` traits, in an additive fashion,\ndepending on how the closure\u2019s body handles the values:\n\n* `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement\n  at least this trait because all closures can be called. A closure that moves\n  captured values out of its body will only implement `FnOnce` and none of the\n  other `Fn` traits because it can only be called once.\n* `FnMut` applies to closures that don\u2019t move captured values out of their body\n  but might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than\n  once.\n* `Fn` applies to closures that don\u2019t move captured values out of their body\n  and don\u2019t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing\n  from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without\n  mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the definition of the `unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>` that\nwe used in Listing 13-1:\n\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Option<T> {\n    pub fn unwrap_or_else<F>(self, f: F) -> T\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -> T\n    {\n        match self {\n            Some(x) => x,\n            None => f(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRecall that `T` is the generic type representing the type of the value in the\n`Some` variant of an `Option`. That type `T` is also the return type of the\n`unwrap_or_else` function: Code that calls `unwrap_or_else` on an\n`Option<String>`, for example, will get a `String`.\n\nNext, notice that the `unwrap_or_else` function has the additional generic type\nparameter `F`. The `F` type is the type of the parameter named `f`, which is\nthe closure we provide when calling `unwrap_or_else`.\n\nThe trait bound specified on the generic type `F` is `FnOnce() -> T`, which\nmeans `F` must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and return a `T`.\nUsing `FnOnce` in the trait bound expresses the constraint that\n`unwrap_or_else` will not call `f` more than once. In the body of\n`unwrap_or_else`, we can see that if the `Option` is `Some`, `f` won\u2019t be\ncalled. If the `Option` is `None`, `f` will be called once. Because all\nclosures implement `FnOnce`, `unwrap_or_else` accepts all three kinds of\nclosures and is as flexible as it can be.\n\n> Note: If what we want to do doesn\u2019t require capturing a value from the\n> environment, we can use the name of a function rather than a closure where we\n> need something that implements one of the `Fn` traits. For example, on an\n> `Option<Vec<T>>` value, we could call `unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)` to get a\n> new, empty vector if the value is `None`. The compiler automatically\n> implements whichever of the `Fn` traits is applicable for a function\n> definition.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the standard library method `sort_by_key`, defined on slices,\nto see how that differs from `unwrap_or_else` and why `sort_by_key` uses\n`FnMut` instead of `FnOnce` for the trait bound. The closure gets one argument\nin the form of a reference to the current item in the slice being considered,\nand it returns a value of type `K` that can be ordered. This function is useful\nwhen you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item. In\nListing 13-7, we have a list of `Rectangle` instances, and we use `sort_by_key`\nto order them by their `width` attribute from low to high.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using `sort_by_key` to order rectangles by width\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-07/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code prints:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-07/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe reason `sort_by_key` is defined to take an `FnMut` closure is that it calls\nthe closure multiple times: once for each item in the slice. The closure `|r|\nr.width` doesn\u2019t capture, mutate, or move anything out from its environment, so\nit meets the trait bound requirements.\n\nIn contrast, Listing 13-8 shows an example of a closure that implements just\nthe `FnOnce` trait, because it moves a value out of the environment. The\ncompiler won\u2019t let us use this closure with `sort_by_key`.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to use an `FnOnce` closure with `sort_by_key`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-08/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis is a contrived, convoluted way (that doesn\u2019t work) to try to count the\nnumber of times `sort_by_key` calls the closure when sorting `list`. This code\nattempts to do this counting by pushing `value`\u2014a `String` from the closure\u2019s\nenvironment\u2014into the `sort_operations` vector. The closure captures `value` and\nthen moves `value` out of the closure by transferring ownership of `value` to\nthe `sort_operations` vector. This closure can be called once; trying to call\nit a second time wouldn\u2019t work, because `value` would no longer be in the\nenvironment to be pushed into `sort_operations` again! Therefore, this closure\nonly implements `FnOnce`. When we try to compile this code, we get this error\nthat `value` can\u2019t be moved out of the closure because the closure must\nimplement `FnMut`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-08/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error points to the line in the closure body that moves `value` out of the\nenvironment. To fix this, we need to change the closure body so that it doesn\u2019t\nmove values out of the environment. Keeping a counter in the environment and\nincrementing its value in the closure body is a more straightforward way to\ncount the number of times the closure is called. The closure in Listing 13-9\nworks with `sort_by_key` because it is only capturing a mutable reference to the\n`num_sort_operations` counter and can therefore be called more than once.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-9\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using an `FnMut` closure with `sort_by_key` is allowed.\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-09/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `Fn` traits are important when defining or using functions or types that\nmake use of closures. In the next section, we\u2019ll discuss iterators. Many\niterator methods take closure arguments, so keep these closure details in mind\nas we continue!\n\n[unwrap-or-else]: ../std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_else",

    "content": "## Processing a Series of Items with Iterators\n\nThe iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in\nturn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and\ndetermining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don\u2019t\nhave to reimplement that logic yourself.\n\nIn Rust, iterators are _lazy_, meaning they have no effect until you call\nmethods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in\nListing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector `v1` by calling\nthe `iter` method defined on `Vec<T>`. This code by itself doesn\u2019t do anything\nuseful.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating an iterator\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-10/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe iterator is stored in the `v1_iter` variable. Once we\u2019ve created an\niterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing 3-5, we iterated over\nan array using a `for` loop to execute some code on each of its items. Under\nthe hood, this implicitly created and then consumed an iterator, but we glossed\nover how exactly that works until now.\n\nIn the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the iterator from\nthe use of the iterator in the `for` loop. When the `for` loop is called using\nthe iterator in `v1_iter`, each element in the iterator is used in one\niteration of the loop, which prints out each value.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using an iterator in a `for` loop\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn languages that don\u2019t have iterators provided by their standard libraries,\nyou would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index\n0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and\nincrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of\nitems in the vector.\n\nIterators handle all of that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you\ncould potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same\nlogic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can\nindex into, like vectors.

The definition of the trait looks like this:\n\n```rust\npub trait Iterator {\n    type Item;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;\n\n    // methods with default implementations elided\n}\n```\n\nNotice that this definition uses some new syntax: `type Item` and `Self::Item`,\nwhich are defining an associated type with this trait. We\u2019ll talk about\nassociated types in depth in Chapter 20. For now, all you need to know is that\nthis code says implementing the `Iterator` trait requires that you also define\nan `Item` type, and this `Item` type is used in the return type of the `next`\nmethod. In other words, the `Item` type will be the type returned from the\niterator.\n\nThe `Iterator` trait only requires implementors to define one method: the\n`next` method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time, wrapped in\n`Some`, and, when iteration is over, returns `None`.\n\nWe can call the `next` method on iterators directly; Listing 13-12 demonstrates\nwhat values are returned from repeated calls to `next` on the iterator created\nfrom the vector.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-12\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Calling the `next` method on an iterator\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-12/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that we needed to make `v1_iter` mutable: Calling the `next` method on an\niterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep track of where\nit is in the sequence. In other words, this code _consumes_, or uses up, the\niterator. Each call to `next` eats up an item from the iterator. We didn\u2019t need\nto make `v1_iter` mutable when we used a `for` loop, because the loop took\nownership of `v1_iter` and made it mutable behind the scenes.\n\nAlso note that the values we get from the calls to `next` are immutable\nreferences to the values in the vector. The `iter` method produces an iterator\nover immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes\nownership of `v1` and returns owned values, we can call `into_iter` instead of\n`iter`. Similarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call\n`iter_mut` instead of `iter`.",

This\nwon\u2019t compile until we update `Config::build` as well.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-18\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Passing the return value of `env::args` to `Config::build`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-18/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `env::args` function returns an iterator! Rather than collecting the\niterator values into a vector and then passing a slice to `Config::build`, now\nwe\u2019re passing ownership of the iterator returned from `env::args` to\n`Config::build` directly.\n\nNext, we need to update the definition of `Config::build`. Let\u2019s change the\nsignature of `Config::build` to look like Listing 13-19. This still won\u2019t\ncompile, because we need to update the function body.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-19\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Updating the signature of `Config::build` to expect an iterator\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-19/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe standard library documentation for the `env::args` function shows that the\ntype of the iterator it returns is `std::env::Args`, and that type implements\nthe `Iterator` trait and returns `String` values.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the signature of the `Config::build` function so that the\nparameter `args` has a generic type with the trait bounds `impl Iterator<Item =\nString>` instead of `&[String]`. This usage of the `impl Trait` syntax we\ndiscussed in the [\u201cUsing Traits as Parameters\u201d][impl-trait]<!-- ignore -->\nsection of Chapter 10 means that `args` can be any type that implements the\n`Iterator` trait and returns `String` items.\n\nBecause we\u2019re taking ownership of `args` and we\u2019ll be mutating `args` by\niterating over it, we can add the `mut` keyword into the specification of the\n`args` parameter to make it mutable.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"using-iterator-trait-methods-instead-of-indexing\"></a>\n\n#### Using `Iterator` Trait Methods\n\nNext, we\u2019ll fix the body of `Config::build`. Because `args` implements the\n`Iterator` trait, we know we can call the `next` method on it! Listing 13-20\nupdates the code from Listing 12-23 to use the `next` method.\n\n<Listing number=\"13-20\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Changing the body of `Config::build` to use iterator methods\">\n\n```rust,ignore,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch13-functional-features/listing-13-20/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRemember that the first value in the return value of `env::args` is the name of\nthe program. We want to ignore that and get to the next value, so first we call\n`next` and do nothing with the return value. Then, we call `next` to get the\nvalue we want to put in the `query` field of `Config`. If `next` returns\n`Some`, we use a `match` to extract the value. If it returns `None`, it means\nnot enough arguments were given, and we return early with an `Err` value. We do\nthe same thing for the `file_path` value.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

The\nfunctional programming style prefers to minimize the amount of mutable state to\nmake code clearer. Removing the mutable state might enable a future enhancement\nto make searching happen in parallel because we wouldn\u2019t have to manage\nconcurrent access to the `results` vector.

Similar to the `filter` example in Listing\n13-16, this code uses the `filter` adapter to keep only the lines for which\n`line.contains(query)` returns `true`. We then collect the matching lines into\nanother vector with `collect`. Much simpler! Feel free to make the same change\nto use iterator methods in the `search_case_insensitive` function as well.\n\nFor a further improvement, return an iterator from the `search` function by\nremoving the call to `collect` and changing the return type to `impl\nIterator<Item = &'a str>` so that the function becomes an iterator adapter.\nNote that you\u2019ll also need to update the tests! Search through a large file\nusing your `minigrep` tool before and after making this change to observe the\ndifference in behavior. Before this change, the program won\u2019t print any results\nuntil it has collected all of the results, but after the change, the results\nwill be printed as each matching line is found because the `for` loop in the\n`run` function is able to take advantage of the laziness of the iterator.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Here are the results of the benchmark on the\nversion of `search` using the `for` loop and the version using iterators:\n\n```text\ntest bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)\ntest bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)\n```\n\nThe two implementations have similar performance! We won\u2019t explain the\nbenchmark code here because the point is not to prove that the two versions\nare equivalent but to get a general sense of how these two implementations\ncompare performance-wise.\n\nFor a more comprehensive benchmark, you should check using various texts of\nvarious sizes as the `contents`, different words and words of different lengths\nas the `query`, and all kinds of other variations. The point is this:\nIterators, although a high-level abstraction, get compiled down to roughly the\nsame code as if you\u2019d written the lower-level code yourself. Iterators are one\nof Rust\u2019s _zero-cost abstractions_, by which we mean that using the abstraction\nimposes no additional runtime overhead. This is analogous to how Bjarne\nStroustrup, the original designer and implementor of C++, defines\nzero-overhead in his 2012 ETAPS keynote presentation \u201cFoundations of C++\u201d:\n\n> In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you\n> don\u2019t use, you don\u2019t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn\u2019t hand\n> code any better.\n\nIn many cases, Rust code using iterators compiles to the same assembly you\u2019d\nwrite by hand. Optimizations such as loop unrolling and eliminating bounds\nchecking on array access apply and make the resultant code extremely efficient.\nNow that you know this, you can use iterators and closures without fear! They\nmake code seem like it\u2019s higher level but don\u2019t impose a runtime performance\npenalty for doing so.\n\n## Summary\n\nClosures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming\nlanguage ideas. They contribute to Rust\u2019s capability to clearly express\nhigh-level ideas at low-level performance. The implementations of closures and\niterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of\nRust\u2019s goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let\u2019s look at\nsome more features of `cargo` that will help us share the project with the\nworld.",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "## Customizing Builds with Release Profiles\n\nIn Rust, _release profiles_ are predefined, customizable profiles with\ndifferent configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over\nvarious options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently of\nthe others.\n\nCargo has two main profiles: the `dev` profile Cargo uses when you run `cargo\nbuild`, and the `release` profile Cargo uses when you run `cargo build\n--release`. The `dev` profile is defined with good defaults for development,\nand the `release` profile has good defaults for release builds.\n\nThese profile names might be familiar from the output of your builds:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\nanywhere, run:\ncargo build\ncargo build --release\nand ensure output below is accurate\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo build\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s\n$ cargo build --release\n    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.32s\n```\n\nThe `dev` and `release` are these different profiles used by the compiler.\n\nCargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when you haven't\nexplicitly added any `[profile.*]` sections in the project\u2019s _Cargo.toml_ file.\nBy adding `[profile.*]` sections for any profile you want to customize, you\noverride any subset of the default settings. For example, here are the default\nvalues for the `opt-level` setting for the `dev` and `release` profiles:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 0\n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 3\n```\n\nThe `opt-level` setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to\nyour code, with a range of 0 to 3. Applying more optimizations extends\ncompiling time, so if you\u2019re in development and compiling your code often,\nyou\u2019ll want fewer optimizations to compile faster even if the resultant code\nruns slower. The default `opt-level` for `dev` is therefore `0`. When you\u2019re\nready to release your code, it\u2019s best to spend more time compiling. You\u2019ll only\ncompile in release mode once, but you\u2019ll run the compiled program many times,\nso release mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. That is\nwhy the default `opt-level` for the `release` profile is `3`.\n\nYou can override a default setting by adding a different value for it in\n_Cargo.toml_. For example, if we want to use optimization level 1 in the\ndevelopment profile, we can add these two lines to our project\u2019s _Cargo.toml_\nfile:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 1\n```\n\nThis code overrides the default setting of `0`. Now when we run `cargo build`,\nCargo will use the defaults for the `dev` profile plus our customization to\n`opt-level`. Because we set `opt-level` to `1`, Cargo will apply more\noptimizations than the default, but not as many as in a release build.\n\nFor the full list of configuration options and defaults for each profile, see\n[Cargo\u2019s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html).",

In Chapter\n3, we discussed how to comment Rust code using two slashes, `//`. Rust also has\na particular kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as a\n_documentation comment_, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML\ndisplays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended\nfor programmers interested in knowing how to _use_ your crate as opposed to how\nyour crate is _implemented_.\n\nDocumentation comments use three slashes, `///`, instead of two and support\nMarkdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments just\nbefore the item they\u2019re documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments\nfor an `add_one` function in a crate named `my_crate`.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-1\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A documentation comment for a function\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-01/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we give a description of what the `add_one` function does, start a\nsection with the heading `Examples`, and then provide code that demonstrates\nhow to use the `add_one` function. We can generate the HTML documentation from\nthis documentation comment by running `cargo doc`. This command runs the\n`rustdoc` tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation\nin the _target/doc_ directory.\n\nFor convenience, running `cargo doc --open` will build the HTML for your\ncurrent crate\u2019s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your\ncrate\u2019s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the\n`add_one` function and you\u2019ll see how the text in the documentation comments is\nrendered, as shown in Figure 14-1.\n\n<img alt=\"Rendered HTML documentation for the `add_one` function of `my_crate`\" src=\"img/trpl14-01.png\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-1: The HTML documentation for the `add_one`\nfunction</span>\n\n#### Commonly Used Sections\n\nWe used the `# Examples` Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section\nin the HTML with the title \u201cExamples.\u201d Here are some other sections that crate\nauthors commonly use in their documentation:\n\n- **Panics**: These are the scenarios in which the function being documented\n  could panic. Callers of the function who don\u2019t want their programs to panic\n  should make sure they don\u2019t call the function in these situations.\n- **Errors**: If the function returns a `Result`, describing the kinds of\n  errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be\n  returned can be helpful to callers so that they can write code to handle the\n  different kinds of errors in different ways.\n- **Safety**: If the function is `unsafe` to call (we discuss unsafety in\n  Chapter 20), there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe\n  and covering the invariants that the function expects callers to uphold.\n\nMost documentation comments don\u2019t need all of these sections, but this is a\ngood checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will be\ninterested in knowing about.\n\n#### Documentation Comments as Tests\n\nAdding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate\nhow to use your library and has an additional bonus: Running `cargo test` will\nrun the code examples in your documentation as tests! Nothing is better than\ndocumentation with examples. But nothing is worse than examples that don\u2019t work\nbecause the code has changed since the documentation was written. If we run\n`cargo test` with the documentation for the `add_one` function from Listing\n14-1, we will see a section in the test results that looks like this:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-01/\ncargo test\ncopy just the doc-tests section below\n-->\n\n```text\n   Doc-tests my_crate\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s\n```\n\nNow, if we change either the function or the example so that the `assert_eq!`\nin the example panics, and run `cargo test` again, we\u2019ll see that the doc tests\ncatch that the example and the code are out of sync with each other!\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"commenting-contained-items\"></a>\n\n#### Contained Item Comments\n\nThe style of doc comment `//!` adds documentation to the item that *contains*\nthe comments rather than to the items *following* the comments. We typically\nuse these doc comments inside the crate root file (_src/lib.rs_ by convention)\nor inside a module to document the crate or the module as a whole.\n\nFor example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the `my_crate`\ncrate that contains the `add_one` function, we add documentation comments that\nstart with `//!` to the beginning of the _src/lib.rs_ file, as shown in Listing\n14-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-2\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"The documentation for the `my_crate` crate as a whole\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-02/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNotice there isn\u2019t any code after the last line that begins with `//!`. Because\nwe started the comments with `//!` instead of `///`, we\u2019re documenting the item\nthat contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In\nthis case, that item is the _src/lib.rs_ file, which is the crate root. These\ncomments describe the entire crate.\n\nWhen we run `cargo doc --open`, these comments will display on the front page\nof the documentation for `my_crate` above the list of public items in the\ncrate, as shown in Figure 14-2.\n\nDocumentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and\nmodules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to\nhelp your users understand the crate\u2019s organization.\n\n<img alt=\"Rendered HTML documentation with a comment for the crate as a whole\" src=\"img/trpl14-02.png\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-2: The rendered documentation for `my_crate`,\nincluding the comment describing the crate as a whole</span>\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a\ncrate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you\nare and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate\nhas a large module hierarchy.\n\nIn Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the `pub` keyword, and\nhow to bring items into a scope with the `use` keyword. However, the structure\nthat makes sense to you while you\u2019re developing a crate might not be very\nconvenient for your users. You might want to organize your structs in a\nhierarchy containing multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type\nyou\u2019ve defined deep in the hierarchy might have trouble finding out that type\nexists. They might also be annoyed at having to enter `use\nmy_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;` rather than `use\nmy_crate::UsefulType;`.\n\nThe good news is that if the structure _isn\u2019t_ convenient for others to use\nfrom another library, you don\u2019t have to rearrange your internal organization:\nInstead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that\u2019s different\nfrom your private structure by using `pub use`. *Re-exporting* takes a public\nitem in one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were\ndefined in the other location instead.\n\nFor example, say we made a library named `art` for modeling artistic concepts.\nWithin this library are two modules: a `kinds` module containing two enums\nnamed `PrimaryColor` and `SecondaryColor` and a `utils` module containing a\nfunction named `mix`, as shown in Listing 14-3.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-3\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An `art` library with items organized into `kinds` and `utils` modules\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,test_harness\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-03/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFigure 14-3 shows what the front page of the documentation for this crate\ngenerated by `cargo doc` would look like.\n\n<img alt=\"Rendered documentation for the `art` crate that lists the `kinds` and `utils` modules\" src=\"img/trpl14-03.png\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-3: The front page of the documentation for `art`\nthat lists the `kinds` and `utils` modules</span>\n\nNote that the `PrimaryColor` and `SecondaryColor` types aren\u2019t listed on the\nfront page, nor is the `mix` function. We have to click `kinds` and `utils` to\nsee them.\n\nAnother crate that depends on this library would need `use` statements that\nbring the items from `art` into scope, specifying the module structure that\u2019s\ncurrently defined. Listing 14-4 shows an example of a crate that uses the\n`PrimaryColor` and `mix` items from the `art` crate.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A crate using the `art` crate\u2019s items with its internal structure exported\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-04/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe author of the code in Listing 14-4, which uses the `art` crate, had to\nfigure out that `PrimaryColor` is in the `kinds` module and `mix` is in the\n`utils` module. The module structure of the `art` crate is more relevant to\ndevelopers working on the `art` crate than to those using it. The internal\nstructure doesn\u2019t contain any useful information for someone trying to\nunderstand how to use the `art` crate, but rather causes confusion because\ndevelopers who use it have to figure out where to look, and must specify the\nmodule names in the `use` statements.\n\nTo remove the internal organization from the public API, we can modify the\n`art` crate code in Listing 14-3 to add `pub use` statements to re-export the\nitems at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-5\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding `pub use` statements to re-export items\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-05/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe API documentation that `cargo doc` generates for this crate will now list\nand link re-exports on the front page, as shown in Figure 14-4, making the\n`PrimaryColor` and `SecondaryColor` types and the `mix` function easier to find.\n\n<img alt=\"Rendered documentation for the `art` crate with the re-exports on the front page\" src=\"img/trpl14-04.png\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-4: The front page of the documentation for `art`\nthat lists the re-exports</span>\n\nThe `art` crate users can still see and use the internal structure from Listing\n14-3 as demonstrated in Listing 14-4, or they can use the more convenient\nstructure in Listing 14-5, as shown in Listing 14-6.\n\n<Listing number=\"14-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A program using the re-exported items from the `art` crate\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/listing-14-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn cases where there are many nested modules, re-exporting the types at the top\nlevel with `pub use` can make a significant difference in the experience of\npeople who use the crate. Another common use of `pub use` is to re-export\ndefinitions of a dependency in the current crate to make that crate's\ndefinitions part of your crate\u2019s public API.\n\nCreating a useful public API structure is more an art than a science, and you\ncan iterate to find the API that works best for your users. Choosing `pub use`\ngives you flexibility in how you structure your crate internally and decouples\nthat internal structure from what you present to your users. Look at some of\nthe code of crates you\u2019ve installed to see if their internal structure differs\nfrom their public API.",

However, crate names on\n[crates.io](https://crates.io/)<!-- ignore --> are allocated on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis. Once a crate name is taken, no one else can publish a crate\nwith that name. Before attempting to publish a crate, search for the name you\nwant to use. If the name has been used, you will need to find another name and\nedit the `name` field in the _Cargo.toml_ file under the `[package]` section to\nuse the new name for publishing, like so:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"guessing_game\"\n```\n\nEven if you\u2019ve chosen a unique name, when you run `cargo publish` to publish\nthe crate at this point, you\u2019ll get a warning and then an error:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\nCreate a new package with an unregistered name, making no further modifications\n  to the generated package, so it is missing the description and license fields.\ncargo publish\ncopy just the relevant lines below\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo publish\n    Updating crates.io index\nwarning: manifest has no description, license, license-file, documentation, homepage or repository.\nSee https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#package-metadata for more info.\n--snip--\nerror: failed to publish to registry at https://crates.io\n\nCaused by:\n  the remote server responded with an error (status 400 Bad Request): missing or empty metadata fields: description, license.

In _Cargo.toml_, add a description\nthat's just a sentence or two, because it will appear with your crate in search\nresults. For the `license` field, you need to give a _license identifier\nvalue_. The [Linux Foundation\u2019s Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)][spdx]\nlists the identifiers you can use for this value. For example, to specify that\nyou\u2019ve licensed your crate using the MIT License, add the `MIT` identifier:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"guessing_game\"\nlicense = \"MIT\"\n```\n\nIf you want to use a license that doesn\u2019t appear in the SPDX, you need to place\nthe text of that license in a file, include the file in your project, and then\nuse `license-file` to specify the name of that file instead of using the\n`license` key.\n\nGuidance on which license is appropriate for your project is beyond the scope\nof this book. Many people in the Rust community license their projects in the\nsame way as Rust by using a dual license of `MIT OR Apache-2.0`. This practice\ndemonstrates that you can also specify multiple license identifiers separated\nby `OR` to have multiple licenses for your project.\n\nWith a unique name, the version, your description, and a license added, the\n_Cargo.toml_ file for a project that is ready to publish might look like this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"guessing_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2024\"\ndescription = \"A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen.\"\nlicense = \"MIT OR Apache-2.0\"\n\n[dependencies]\n```\n\n[Cargo\u2019s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) describes other\nmetadata you can specify to ensure that others can discover and use your crate\nmore easily.",

Let\u2019s make a project using a workspace\u2014we\u2019ll use trivial code so\nthat we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple\nways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We\u2019ll have a\nworkspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide\nthe main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will\nprovide an `add_one` function and the other library an `add_two` function.\nThese three crates will be part of the same workspace. We\u2019ll start by creating\na new directory for the workspace:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir add\n$ cd add\n```\n\nNext, in the _add_ directory, we create the _Cargo.toml_ file that will\nconfigure the entire workspace. This file won\u2019t have a `[package]` section.\nInstead, it will start with a `[workspace]` section that will allow us to add\nmembers to the workspace. We also make a point to use the latest and greatest\nversion of Cargo\u2019s resolver algorithm in our workspace by setting the\n`resolver` value to `\"3\"`:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span>\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/no-listing-01-workspace/add/Cargo.toml}}\n```\n\nNext, we\u2019ll create the `adder` binary crate by running `cargo new` within the\n_add_ directory:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-01-adder-crate/add\nremove `members = [\"adder\"]` from Cargo.toml\nrm -rf adder\ncargo new adder\ncopy output below\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo new adder\n     Created binary (application) `adder` package\n      Adding `adder` as member of workspace at `file:///projects/add`\n```\n\nRunning `cargo new` inside a workspace also automatically adds the newly created\npackage to the `members` key in the `[workspace]` definition in the workspace\n_Cargo.toml_, like this:\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-01-adder-crate/add/Cargo.toml}}\n```\n\nAt this point, we can build the workspace by running `cargo build`. The files\nin your _add_ directory should look like this:\n\n```text\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 adder\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.rs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 target\n```\n\nThe workspace has one _target_ directory at the top level that the compiled\nartifacts will be placed into; the `adder` package doesn\u2019t have its own\n_target_ directory. Even if we were to run `cargo build` from inside the\n_adder_ directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in _add/target_\nrather than _add/adder/target_. Cargo structures the _target_ directory in a\nworkspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on\neach other. If each crate had its own _target_ directory, each crate would have\nto recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts\nin its own _target_ directory.

    "content": "# Smart Pointers\n\nA pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in\nmemory. This address refers to, or \u201cpoints at,\u201d some other data. The most\ncommon kind of pointer in Rust is a reference, which you learned about in\nChapter 4. References are indicated by the `&` symbol and borrow the value they\npoint to. They don\u2019t have any special capabilities other than referring to\ndata, and they have no overhead.\n\n_Smart pointers_, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a\npointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities. The concept of\nsmart pointers isn\u2019t unique to Rust: Smart pointers originated in C++ and exist\nin other languages as well. Rust has a variety of smart pointers defined in the\nstandard library that provide functionality beyond that provided by references.\nTo explore the general concept, we\u2019ll look at a couple of different examples of\nsmart pointers, including a _reference counting_ smart pointer type. This\npointer enables you to allow data to have multiple owners by keeping track of\nthe number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.\n\nIn Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, there is an additional\ndifference between references and smart pointers: While references only borrow\ndata, in many cases smart pointers _own_ the data they point to.\n\nSmart pointers are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary\nstruct, smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits. The `Deref`\ntrait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference\nso that you can write your code to work with either references or smart\npointers. The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that\u2019s run when an\ninstance of the smart pointer goes out of scope. In this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss\nboth of these traits and demonstrate why they\u2019re important to smart pointers.\n\nGiven that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used\nfrequently in Rust, this chapter won\u2019t cover every existing smart pointer. Many\nlibraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own. We\u2019ll\ncover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:\n\n- `Box<T>`, for allocating values on the heap\n- `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership\n- `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces\n  the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ll cover the _interior mutability_ pattern where an immutable\ntype exposes an API for mutating an interior value. We\u2019ll also discuss\nreference cycles: how they can leak memory and how to prevent them.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in!",

    "content": "## Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap\n\nThe most straightforward smart pointer is a box, whose type is written\n`Box<T>`. _Boxes_ allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack.\nWhat remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. Refer to Chapter 4\nto review the difference between the stack and the heap.\n\nBoxes don\u2019t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the\nheap instead of on the stack. But they don\u2019t have many extra capabilities\neither. You\u2019ll use them most often in these situations:\n\n- When you have a type whose size can\u2019t be known at compile time, and you want\n  to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size\n- When you have a large amount of data, and you want to transfer ownership but\n  ensure that the data won\u2019t be copied when you do so\n- When you want to own a value, and you care only that it\u2019s a type that\n  implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type\n\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate the first situation in [\u201cEnabling Recursive Types with\nBoxes\u201d](#enabling-recursive-types-with-boxes)<!-- ignore -->. In the second\ncase, transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time\nbecause the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this\nsituation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box. Then,\nonly the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the\ndata it references stays in one place on the heap. The third case is known as a\n_trait object_, and [\u201cUsing Trait Objects to Abstract over Shared\nBehavior\u201d][trait-objects]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 18 is devoted to that\ntopic.

Recursive types pose an issue because Rust needs to know at compile time\nhow much space a type takes up. However, the nesting of values of recursive\ntypes could theoretically continue infinitely, so Rust can\u2019t know how much space\nthe value needs. Because boxes have a known size, we can enable recursive types\nby inserting a box in the recursive type definition.\n\nAs an example of a recursive type, let\u2019s explore the cons list. This is a data\ntype commonly found in functional programming languages. The cons list type\nwe\u2019ll define is straightforward except for the recursion; therefore, the\nconcepts in the example we\u2019ll work with will be useful anytime you get into\nmore complex situations involving recursive types.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"more-information-about-the-cons-list\"></a>\n\n#### Understanding the Cons List\n\nA _cons list_ is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming language\nand its dialects, is made up of nested pairs, and is the Lisp version of a\nlinked list. Its name comes from the `cons` function (short for _construct\nfunction_) in Lisp that constructs a new pair from its two arguments. By\ncalling `cons` on a pair consisting of a value and another pair, we can\nconstruct cons lists made up of recursive pairs.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a pseudocode representation of a cons list containing the\nlist `1, 2, 3` with each pair in parentheses:\n\n```text\n(1, (2, (3, Nil)))\n```\n\nEach item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current item\nand of the next item. The last item in the list contains only a value called\n`Nil` without a next item. A cons list is produced by recursively calling the\n`cons` function. The canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is\n`Nil`. Note that this is not the same as the \u201cnull\u201d or \u201cnil\u201d concept discussed\nin Chapter 6, which is an invalid or absent value.\n\nThe cons list isn\u2019t a commonly used data structure in Rust. Most of the time\nwhen you have a list of items in Rust, `Vec<T>` is a better choice to use.\nOther, more complex recursive data types _are_ useful in various situations,\nbut by starting with the cons list in this chapter, we can explore how boxes\nlet us define a recursive data type without much distraction.\n\nListing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list. Note that this code\nwon\u2019t compile yet, because the `List` type doesn\u2019t have a known size, which\nwe\u2019ll demonstrate.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The first attempt at defining an enum to represent a cons list data structure of `i32` values\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\n> Note: We\u2019re implementing a cons list that holds only `i32` values for the\n> purposes of this example. We could have implemented it using generics, as we\n> discussed in Chapter 10, to define a cons list type that could store values of\n> any type.\n\nUsing the `List` type to store the list `1, 2, 3` would look like the code in\nListing 15-3.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using the `List` enum to store the list `1, 2, 3`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe first `Cons` value holds `1` and another `List` value. This `List` value is\nanother `Cons` value that holds `2` and another `List` value. This `List` value\nis one more `Cons` value that holds `3` and a `List` value, which is finally\n`Nil`, the non-recursive variant that signals the end of the list.\n\nIf we try to compile the code in Listing 15-3, we get the error shown in\nListing 15-4.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-4\" caption=\"The error we get when attempting to define a recursive enum\">\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-03/output.txt}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe error shows this type \u201chas infinite size.\u201d The reason is that we\u2019ve defined\n`List` with a variant that is recursive: It holds another value of itself\ndirectly. As a result, Rust can\u2019t figure out how much space it needs to store a\n`List` value. Let\u2019s break down why we get this error. First, we\u2019ll look at how\nRust decides how much space it needs to store a value of a non-recursive type.\n\n#### Computing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type\n\nRecall the `Message` enum we defined in Listing 6-2 when we discussed enum\ndefinitions in Chapter 6:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nTo determine how much space to allocate for a `Message` value, Rust goes\nthrough each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space. Rust\nsees that `Message::Quit` doesn\u2019t need any space, `Message::Move` needs enough\nspace to store two `i32` values, and so forth. Because only one variant will be\nused, the most space a `Message` value will need is the space it would take to\nstore the largest of its variants.\n\nContrast this with what happens when Rust tries to determine how much space a\nrecursive type like the `List` enum in Listing 15-2 needs. The compiler starts\nby looking at the `Cons` variant, which holds a value of type `i32` and a value\nof type `List`. Therefore, `Cons` needs an amount of space equal to the size of\nan `i32` plus the size of a `List`. To figure out how much memory the `List`\ntype needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the `Cons`\nvariant. The `Cons` variant holds a value of type `i32` and a value of type\n`List`, and this process continues infinitely, as shown in Figure 15-1.\n\n<img alt=\"An infinite Cons list: a rectangle labeled 'Cons' split into two smaller rectangles.

This means we can put a `Box<T>` inside the `Cons` variant instead\nof another `List` value directly. The `Box<T>` will point to the next `List`\nvalue that will be on the heap rather than inside the `Cons` variant.\nConceptually, we still have a list, created with lists holding other lists, but\nthis implementation is now more like placing the items next to one another\nrather than inside one another.\n\nWe can change the definition of the `List` enum in Listing 15-2 and the usage\nof the `List` in Listing 15-3 to the code in Listing 15-5, which will compile.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-5\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The definition of `List` that uses `Box<T>` in order to have a known size\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-05/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `Cons` variant needs the size of an `i32` plus the space to store the box\u2019s\npointer data. The `Nil` variant stores no values, so it needs less space on the\nstack than the `Cons` variant. We now know that any `List` value will take up\nthe size of an `i32` plus the size of a box\u2019s pointer data. By using a box,\nwe\u2019ve broken the infinite, recursive chain, so the compiler can figure out the\nsize it needs to store a `List` value. Figure 15-2 shows what the `Cons`\nvariant looks like now.\n\n<img alt=\"A rectangle labeled 'Cons' split into two smaller rectangles.

We\u2019ll look at more use cases for boxes\nin Chapter 18.\n\nThe `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer because it implements the `Deref` trait,\nwhich allows `Box<T>` values to be treated like references. When a `Box<T>`\nvalue goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned\nup as well because of the `Drop` trait implementation.

By implementing `Deref` in such a way that a smart pointer can be\ntreated like a regular reference, you can write code that operates on\nreferences and use that code with smart pointers too.\n\nLet\u2019s first look at how the dereference operator works with regular references.\nThen, we\u2019ll try to define a custom type that behaves like `Box<T>` and see why\nthe dereference operator doesn\u2019t work like a reference on our newly defined\ntype. We\u2019ll explore how implementing the `Deref` trait makes it possible for\nsmart pointers to work in ways similar to references.

Associated types are a slightly different way of declaring a generic\nparameter, but you don\u2019t need to worry about them for now; we\u2019ll cover them in\nmore detail in Chapter 20.\n\nWe fill in the body of the `deref` method with `&self.0` so that `deref`\nreturns a reference to the value we want to access with the `*` operator;\nrecall from [\u201cCreating Different Types with Tuple Structs\u201d][tuple-structs]<!--\nignore --> in Chapter 5 that `.0` accesses the first value in a tuple struct.\nThe `main` function in Listing 15-9 that calls `*` on the `MyBox<T>` value now\ncompiles, and the assertions pass!\n\nWithout the `Deref` trait, the compiler can only dereference `&` references.\nThe `deref` method gives the compiler the ability to take a value of any type\nthat implements `Deref` and call the `deref` method to get a reference that\nit knows how to dereference.\n\nWhen we entered `*y` in Listing 15-9, behind the scenes Rust actually ran this\ncode:\n\n```rust,ignore\n*(y.deref())\n```\n\nRust substitutes the `*` operator with a call to the `deref` method and then a\nplain dereference so that we don\u2019t have to think about whether or not we need\nto call the `deref` method. This Rust feature lets us write code that functions\nidentically whether we have a regular reference or a type that implements\n`Deref`.\n\nThe reason the `deref` method returns a reference to a value, and that the\nplain dereference outside the parentheses in `*(y.deref())` is still necessary,\nhas to do with the ownership system. If the `deref` method returned the value\ndirectly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of\n`self`. We don\u2019t want to take ownership of the inner value inside `MyBox<T>` in\nthis case or in most cases where we use the dereference operator.\n\nNote that the `*` operator is replaced with a call to the `deref` method and\nthen a call to the `*` operator just once, each time we use a `*` in our code.\nBecause the substitution of the `*` operator does not recurse infinitely, we\nend up with data of type `i32`, which matches the `5` in `assert_eq!` in\nListing 15-9.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

For example, deref coercion can convert\n`&String` to `&str` because `String` implements the `Deref` trait such that it\nreturns `&str`. Deref coercion is a convenience Rust performs on arguments to\nfunctions and methods, and it works only on types that implement the `Deref`\ntrait. It happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type\u2019s\nvalue as an argument to a function or method that doesn\u2019t match the parameter\ntype in the function or method definition. A sequence of calls to the `deref`\nmethod converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs.\n\nDeref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and\nmethod calls don\u2019t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences\nwith `&` and `*`. The deref coercion feature also lets us write more code that\ncan work for either references or smart pointers.\n\nTo see deref coercion in action, let\u2019s use the `MyBox<T>` type we defined in\nListing 15-8 as well as the implementation of `Deref` that we added in Listing\n15-10. Listing 15-11 shows the definition of a function that has a string slice\nparameter.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `hello` function that has the parameter `name` of type `&str`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe can call the `hello` function with a string slice as an argument, such as\n`hello(\"Rust\");`, for example.

Because we implemented the `Deref` trait\non `MyBox<T>` in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn `&MyBox<String>` into `&String`\nby calling `deref`. The standard library provides an implementation of `Deref`\non `String` that returns a string slice, and this is in the API documentation\nfor `Deref`. Rust calls `deref` again to turn the `&String` into `&str`, which\nmatches the `hello` function\u2019s definition.\n\nIf Rust didn\u2019t implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code in\nListing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call `hello` with a value\nof type `&MyBox<String>`.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-13\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The code we would have to write if Rust didn\u2019t have deref coercion\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-13/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `(*m)` dereferences the `MyBox<String>` into a `String`. Then, the `&` and\n`[..]` take a string slice of the `String` that is equal to the whole string to\nmatch the signature of `hello`. This code without deref coercions is harder to\nread, write, and understand with all of these symbols involved. Deref coercion\nallows Rust to handle these conversions for us automatically.\n\nWhen the `Deref` trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the\ntypes and use `Deref::deref` as many times as necessary to get a reference to\nmatch the parameter\u2019s type.

You can\nprovide an implementation for the `Drop` trait on any type, and that code can\nbe used to release resources like files or network connections.\n\nWe\u2019re introducing `Drop` in the context of smart pointers because the\nfunctionality of the `Drop` trait is almost always used when implementing a\nsmart pointer. For example, when a `Box<T>` is dropped, it will deallocate the\nspace on the heap that the box points to.\n\nIn some languages, for some types, the programmer must call code to free memory\nor resources every time they finish using an instance of those types. Examples\ninclude file handles, sockets, and locks. If the programmer forgets, the system\nmight become overloaded and crash. In Rust, you can specify that a particular\nbit of code be run whenever a value goes out of scope, and the compiler will\ninsert this code automatically. As a result, you don\u2019t need to be careful about\nplacing cleanup code everywhere in a program that an instance of a particular\ntype is finished with\u2014you still won\u2019t leak resources!\n\nYou specify the code to run when a value goes out of scope by implementing the\n`Drop` trait. The `Drop` trait requires you to implement one method named\n`drop` that takes a mutable reference to `self`. To see when Rust calls `drop`,\nlet\u2019s implement `drop` with `println!` statements for now.\n\nListing 15-14 shows a `CustomSmartPointer` struct whose only custom\nfunctionality is that it will print `Dropping CustomSmartPointer!` when the\ninstance goes out of scope, to show when Rust runs the `drop` method.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-14\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `CustomSmartPointer` struct that implements the `Drop` trait where we would put our cleanup code\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-14/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `Drop` trait is included in the prelude, so we don\u2019t need to bring it into\nscope. We implement the `Drop` trait on `CustomSmartPointer` and provide an\nimplementation for the `drop` method that calls `println!`. The body of the\n`drop` method is where you would place any logic that you wanted to run when an\ninstance of your type goes out of scope. We\u2019re printing some text here to\ndemonstrate visually when Rust will call `drop`.\n\nIn `main`, we create two instances of `CustomSmartPointer` and then print\n`CustomSmartPointers created`. At the end of `main`, our instances of\n`CustomSmartPointer` will go out of scope, and Rust will call the code we put\nin the `drop` method, printing our final message. Note that we didn\u2019t need to\ncall the `drop` method explicitly.\n\nWhen we run this program, we\u2019ll see the following output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-14/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust automatically called `drop` for us when our instances went out of scope,\ncalling the code we specified. Variables are dropped in the reverse order of\ntheir creation, so `d` was dropped before `c`. This example\u2019s purpose is to\ngive you a visual guide to how the `drop` method works; usually you would\nspecify the cleanup code that your type needs to run rather than a print\nmessage.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Disabling `drop` isn\u2019t usually necessary; the whole point of the\n`Drop` trait is that it\u2019s taken care of automatically. Occasionally, however,\nyou might want to clean up a value early. One example is when using smart\npointers that manage locks: You might want to force the `drop` method that\nreleases the lock so that other code in the same scope can acquire the lock.\nRust doesn\u2019t let you call the `Drop` trait\u2019s `drop` method manually; instead,\nyou have to call the `std::mem::drop` function provided by the standard library\nif you want to force a value to be dropped before the end of its scope.\n\nTrying to call the `Drop` trait\u2019s `drop` method manually by modifying the\n`main` function from Listing 15-14 won\u2019t work, as shown in Listing 15-15.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-15\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to call the `drop` method from the `Drop` trait manually to clean up early\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-15/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we try to compile this code, we\u2019ll get this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-15/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis error message states that we\u2019re not allowed to explicitly call `drop`. The\nerror message uses the term _destructor_, which is the general programming term\nfor a function that cleans up an instance. A _destructor_ is analogous to a\n_constructor_, which creates an instance. The `drop` function in Rust is one\nparticular destructor.\n\nRust doesn\u2019t let us call `drop` explicitly, because Rust would still\nautomatically call `drop` on the value at the end of `main`. This would cause a\ndouble free error because Rust would be trying to clean up the same value twice.\n\nWe can\u2019t disable the automatic insertion of `drop` when a value goes out of\nscope, and we can\u2019t call the `drop` method explicitly. So, if we need to force\na value to be cleaned up early, we use the `std::mem::drop` function.\n\nThe `std::mem::drop` function is different from the `drop` method in the `Drop`\ntrait. We call it by passing as an argument the value we want to force-drop.\nThe function is in the prelude, so we can modify `main` in Listing 15-15 to\ncall the `drop` function, as shown in Listing 15-16.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-16\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Calling `std::mem::drop` to explicitly drop a value before it goes out of scope\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-16/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRunning this code will print the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-16/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe text ``Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `some data`!`` is printed\nbetween the `CustomSmartPointer created` and `CustomSmartPointer dropped before\nthe end of main` text, showing that the `drop` method code is called to drop\n`c` at that point.\n\nYou can use code specified in a `Drop` trait implementation in many ways to\nmake cleanup convenient and safe: For instance, you could use it to create your\nown memory allocator! With the `Drop` trait and Rust\u2019s ownership system, you\ndon\u2019t have to remember to clean up, because Rust does it automatically.\n\nYou also don\u2019t have to worry about problems resulting from accidentally\ncleaning up values still in use: The ownership system that makes sure\nreferences are always valid also ensures that `drop` gets called only once when\nthe value is no longer being used.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve examined `Box<T>` and some of the characteristics of smart\npointers, let\u2019s look at a few other smart pointers defined in the standard\nlibrary.",

However, there are cases when a single value might have\nmultiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might\npoint to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges\nthat point to it. A node shouldn\u2019t be cleaned up unless it doesn\u2019t have any\nedges pointing to it and so has no owners.\n\nYou have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type\n`Rc<T>`, which is an abbreviation for _reference counting_. The `Rc<T>` type\nkeeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not\nthe value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value\ncan be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.\n\nImagine `Rc<T>` as a TV in a family room. When one person enters to watch TV,\nthey turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the last\nperson leaves the room, they turn off the TV because it\u2019s no longer being used.\nIf someone turns off the TV while others are still watching it, there would be\nan uproar from the remaining TV watchers!\n\nWe use the `Rc<T>` type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for\nmultiple parts of our program to read and we can\u2019t determine at compile time\nwhich part will finish using the data last. If we knew which part would finish\nlast, we could just make that part the data\u2019s owner, and the normal ownership\nrules enforced at compile time would take effect.\n\nNote that `Rc<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we discuss\nconcurrency in Chapter 16, we\u2019ll cover how to do reference counting in\nmultithreaded programs.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Then, we\u2019ll make two\nmore lists: `b` that starts with `3` and `c` that starts with `4`. Both the `b`\nand `c` lists will then continue on to the first `a` list containing `5` and\n`10`. In other words, both lists will share the first list containing `5` and\n`10`.\n\nTrying to implement this scenario using our definition of `List` with `Box<T>`\nwon\u2019t work, as shown in Listing 15-17.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-17\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Demonstrating that we\u2019re not allowed to have two lists using `Box<T>` that try to share ownership of a third list\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-17/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we compile this code, we get this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-17/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe `Cons` variants own the data they hold, so when we create the `b` list, `a`\nis moved into `b` and `b` owns `a`. Then, when we try to use `a` again when\ncreating `c`, we\u2019re not allowed to because `a` has been moved.\n\nWe could change the definition of `Cons` to hold references instead, but then\nwe would have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying lifetime\nparameters, we would be specifying that every element in the list will live at\nleast as long as the entire list. This is the case for the elements and lists\nin Listing 15-17, but not in every scenario.\n\nInstead, we\u2019ll change our definition of `List` to use `Rc<T>` in place of\n`Box<T>`, as shown in Listing 15-18. Each `Cons` variant will now hold a value\nand an `Rc<T>` pointing to a `List`. When we create `b`, instead of taking\nownership of `a`, we\u2019ll clone the `Rc<List>` that `a` is holding, thereby\nincreasing the number of references from one to two and letting `a` and `b`\nshare ownership of the data in that `Rc<List>`. We\u2019ll also clone `a` when\ncreating `c`, increasing the number of references from two to three. Every time\nwe call `Rc::clone`, the reference count to the data within the `Rc<List>` will\nincrease, and the data won\u2019t be cleaned up unless there are zero references to\nit.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-18\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A definition of `List` that uses `Rc<T>`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-18/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe need to add a `use` statement to bring `Rc<T>` into scope because it\u2019s not\nin the prelude. In `main`, we create the list holding `5` and `10` and store it\nin a new `Rc<List>` in `a`. Then, when we create `b` and `c`, we call the\n`Rc::clone` function and pass a reference to the `Rc<List>` in `a` as an\nargument.\n\nWe could have called `a.clone()` rather than `Rc::clone(&a)`, but Rust\u2019s\nconvention is to use `Rc::clone` in this case. The implementation of\n`Rc::clone` doesn\u2019t make a deep copy of all the data like most types\u2019\nimplementations of `clone` do. The call to `Rc::clone` only increments the\nreference count, which doesn\u2019t take much time. Deep copies of data can take a\nlot of time. By using `Rc::clone` for reference counting, we can visually\ndistinguish between the deep-copy kinds of clones and the kinds of clones that\nincrease the reference count. When looking for performance problems in the\ncode, we only need to consider the deep-copy clones and can disregard calls to\n`Rc::clone`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

To mutate data, the pattern uses\n`unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend Rust\u2019s usual rules that govern\nmutation and borrowing. Unsafe code indicates to the compiler that we\u2019re\nchecking the rules manually instead of relying on the compiler to check them\nfor us; we will discuss unsafe code more in Chapter 20.\n\nWe can use types that use the interior mutability pattern only when we can\nensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the\ncompiler can\u2019t guarantee that. The `unsafe` code involved is then wrapped in a\nsafe API, and the outer type is still immutable.\n\nLet\u2019s explore this concept by looking at the `RefCell<T>` type that follows the\ninterior mutability pattern.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "Unlike `Rc<T>`, the `RefCell<T>` type represents single ownership over the data\nit holds. So, what makes `RefCell<T>` different from a type like `Box<T>`?\nRecall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:\n\n- At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference or any number\n  of immutable references (but not both).\n- References must always be valid.\n\nWith references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules\u2019 invariants are enforced at\ncompile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced _at runtime_.\nWith references, if you break these rules, you\u2019ll get a compiler error. With\n`RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.\n\nThe advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors\nwill be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on\nruntime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those\nreasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the\nmajority of cases, which is why this is Rust\u2019s default.\n\nThe advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that\ncertain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, where they would\u2019ve been\ndisallowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler,\nis inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by\nanalyzing the code: The most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is\nbeyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.\n\nBecause some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can\u2019t be sure the\ncode complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in\nthis way, it\u2019s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users\nwouldn\u2019t be able to trust the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust rejects a\ncorrect program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing\ncatastrophic can occur. The `RefCell<T>` type is useful when you\u2019re sure your\ncode follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and\nguarantee that.\n\nSimilar to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios\nand will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded\ncontext. We\u2019ll talk about how to get the functionality of `RefCell<T>` in a\nmultithreaded program in Chapter 16.\n\nHere is a recap of the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `RefCell<T>`:\n\n- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>`\n  have single owners.\n- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>`\n  allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows\n  immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.\n- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can\n  mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is\n  immutable.\n\nMutating the value inside an immutable value is the interior mutability\npattern.

This placeholder type is called a _test double_. Think of it in the\nsense of a stunt double in filmmaking, where a person steps in and substitutes\nfor an actor to do a particularly tricky scene. Test doubles stand in for other\ntypes when we\u2019re running tests. _Mock objects_ are specific types of test\ndoubles that record what happens during a test so that you can assert that the\ncorrect actions took place.\n\nRust doesn\u2019t have objects in the same sense as other languages have objects,\nand Rust doesn\u2019t have mock object functionality built into the standard library\nas some other languages do. However, you can definitely create a struct that\nwill serve the same purposes as a mock object.\n\nHere\u2019s the scenario we\u2019ll test: We\u2019ll create a library that tracks a value\nagainst a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to the maximum\nvalue the current value is. This library could be used to keep track of a\nuser\u2019s quota for the number of API calls they\u2019re allowed to make, for example.\n\nOur library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to the\nmaximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times. Applications\nthat use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the\nmessages: The application could show the message to the user directly, send an\nemail, send a text message, or do something else. The library doesn\u2019t need to\nknow that detail. All it needs is something that implements a trait we\u2019ll\nprovide, called `Messenger`. Listing 15-20 shows the library code.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-20\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A library to keep track of how close a value is to a maximum value and warn when the value is at certain levels\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-20/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOne important part of this code is that the `Messenger` trait has one method\ncalled `send` that takes an immutable reference to `self` and the text of the\nmessage. This trait is the interface our mock object needs to implement so that\nthe mock can be used in the same way a real object is. The other important part\nis that we want to test the behavior of the `set_value` method on the\n`LimitTracker`. We can change what we pass in for the `value` parameter, but\n`set_value` doesn\u2019t return anything for us to make assertions on. We want to be\nable to say that if we create a `LimitTracker` with something that implements\nthe `Messenger` trait and a particular value for `max`, the messenger is told\nto send the appropriate messages when we pass different numbers for `value`.\n\nWe need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message when we\ncall `send`, will only keep track of the messages it\u2019s told to send. We can\ncreate a new instance of the mock object, create a `LimitTracker` that uses the\nmock object, call the `set_value` method on `LimitTracker`, and then check that\nthe mock object has the messages we expect. Listing 15-21 shows an attempt to\nimplement a mock object to do just that, but the borrow checker won\u2019t allow it.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-21\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An attempt to implement a `MockMessenger` that isn\u2019t allowed by the borrow checker\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-21/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis test code defines a `MockMessenger` struct that has a `sent_messages`\nfield with a `Vec` of `String` values to keep track of the messages it\u2019s told\nto send. We also define an associated function `new` to make it convenient to\ncreate new `MockMessenger` values that start with an empty list of messages. We\nthen implement the `Messenger` trait for `MockMessenger` so that we can give a\n`MockMessenger` to a `LimitTracker`. In the definition of the `send` method, we\ntake the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the `MockMessenger`\nlist of `sent_messages`.\n\nIn the test, we\u2019re testing what happens when the `LimitTracker` is told to set\n`value` to something that is more than 75 percent of the `max` value. First, we\ncreate a new `MockMessenger`, which will start with an empty list of messages.\nThen, we create a new `LimitTracker` and give it a reference to the new\n`MockMessenger` and a `max` value of `100`. We call the `set_value` method on\nthe `LimitTracker` with a value of `80`, which is more than 75 percent of 100.\nThen, we assert that the list of messages that the `MockMessenger` is keeping\ntrack of should now have one message in it.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one problem with this test, as shown here:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-21/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWe can\u2019t modify the `MockMessenger` to keep track of the messages, because the\n`send` method takes an immutable reference to `self`. We also can\u2019t take the\nsuggestion from the error text to use `&mut self` in both the `impl` method and\nthe trait definition. We do not want to change the `Messenger` trait solely for\nthe sake of testing. Instead, we need to find a way to make our test code work\ncorrectly with our existing design.\n\nThis is a situation in which interior mutability can help! We\u2019ll store the\n`sent_messages` within a `RefCell<T>`, and then the `send` method will be able\nto modify `sent_messages` to store the messages we\u2019ve seen. Listing 15-22 shows\nwhat that looks like.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-22\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Using `RefCell<T>` to mutate an inner value while the outer value is considered immutable\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-22/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `sent_messages` field is now of type `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instead of\n`Vec<String>`. In the `new` function, we create a new `RefCell<Vec<String>>`\ninstance around the empty vector.\n\nFor the implementation of the `send` method, the first parameter is still an\nimmutable borrow of `self`, which matches the trait definition. We call\n`borrow_mut` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` in `self.sent_messages` to get a\nmutable reference to the value inside the `RefCell<Vec<String>>`, which is the\nvector. Then, we can call `push` on the mutable reference to the vector to keep\ntrack of the messages sent during the test.\n\nThe last change we have to make is in the assertion: To see how many items are\nin the inner vector, we call `borrow` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` to get an\nimmutable reference to the vector.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen how to use `RefCell<T>`, let\u2019s dig into how it works!\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"keeping-track-of-borrows-at-runtime-with-refcellt\"></a>\n\n#### Tracking Borrows at Runtime\n\nWhen creating immutable and mutable references, we use the `&` and `&mut`\nsyntax, respectively. With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut`\nmethods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to `RefCell<T>`. The\n`borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref<T>`, and `borrow_mut`\nreturns the smart pointer type `RefMut<T>`. Both types implement `Deref`, so we\ncan treat them like regular references.\n\nThe `RefCell<T>` keeps track of how many `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>` smart\npointers are currently active. Every time we call `borrow`, the `RefCell<T>`\nincreases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a `Ref<T>`\nvalue goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by 1. Just\nlike the compile-time borrowing rules, `RefCell<T>` lets us have many immutable\nborrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.\n\nIf we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as we\nwould with references, the implementation of `RefCell<T>` will panic at\nruntime. Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of `send` in\nListing 15-22. We\u2019re deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows active\nfor the same scope to illustrate that `RefCell<T>` prevents us from doing this\nat runtime.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-23\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Creating two mutable references in the same scope to see that `RefCell<T>` will panic\">\n\n```rust,ignore,panics\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-23/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe create a variable `one_borrow` for the `RefMut<T>` smart pointer returned\nfrom `borrow_mut`. Then, we create another mutable borrow in the same way in\nthe variable `two_borrow`. This makes two mutable references in the same scope,\nwhich isn\u2019t allowed. When we run the tests for our library, the code in Listing\n15-23 will compile without any errors, but the test will fail:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-23/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNotice that the code panicked with the message `already borrowed:\nBorrowMutError`. This is how `RefCell<T>` handles violations of the borrowing\nrules at runtime.\n\nChoosing to catch borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time, as\nwe\u2019ve done here, means you\u2019d potentially be finding mistakes in your code later\nin the development process: possibly not until your code was deployed to\nproduction. Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as\na result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time.\nHowever, using `RefCell<T>` makes it possible to write a mock object that can\nmodify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while you\u2019re using it\nin a context where only immutable values are allowed. You can use `RefCell<T>`\ndespite its trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references\nprovide.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Allowing Multiple Owners of Mutable Data",
    "content": "A common way to use `RefCell<T>` is in combination with `Rc<T>`. Recall that\n`Rc<T>` lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable\naccess to that data. If you have an `Rc<T>` that holds a `RefCell<T>`, you can\nget a value that can have multiple owners _and_ that you can mutate!\n\nFor example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used\n`Rc<T>` to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list. Because\n`Rc<T>` holds only immutable values, we can\u2019t change any of the values in the\nlist once we\u2019ve created them. Let\u2019s add in `RefCell<T>` for its ability to\nchange the values in the lists. Listing 15-24 shows that by using a\n`RefCell<T>` in the `Cons` definition, we can modify the value stored in all\nthe lists.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-24\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using `Rc<RefCell<i32>>` to create a `List` that we can mutate\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-24/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe create a value that is an instance of `Rc<RefCell<i32>>` and store it in a\nvariable named `value` so that we can access it directly later. Then, we create\na `List` in `a` with a `Cons` variant that holds `value`. We need to clone\n`value` so that both `a` and `value` have ownership of the inner `5` value\nrather than transferring ownership from `value` to `a` or having `a` borrow\nfrom `value`.\n\nWe wrap the list `a` in an `Rc<T>` so that when we create lists `b` and `c`,\nthey can both refer to `a`, which is what we did in Listing 15-18.\n\nAfter we\u2019ve created the lists in `a`, `b`, and `c`, we want to add 10 to the\nvalue in `value`. We do this by calling `borrow_mut` on `value`, which uses the\nautomatic dereferencing feature we discussed in [\u201cWhere\u2019s the `->`\nOperator?\u201d][wheres-the---operator]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 5 to dereference\nthe `Rc<T>` to the inner `RefCell<T>` value. The `borrow_mut` method returns a\n`RefMut<T>` smart pointer, and we use the dereference operator on it and change\nthe inner value.\n\nWhen we print `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can see that they all have the modified\nvalue of `15` rather than `5`:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-24/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis technique is pretty neat! By using `RefCell<T>`, we have an outwardly\nimmutable `List` value. But we can use the methods on `RefCell<T>` that provide\naccess to its interior mutability so that we can modify our data when we need\nto. The runtime checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and\nit\u2019s sometimes worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data\nstructures. Note that `RefCell<T>` does not work for multithreaded code!\n`Mutex<T>` is the thread-safe version of `RefCell<T>`, and we\u2019ll discuss\n`Mutex<T>` in Chapter 16.\n\n[wheres-the---operator]: ch05-03-method-syntax.html#wheres-the---operator",

We can see that Rust allows memory leaks\nby using `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`: It\u2019s possible to create references where\nitems refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the\nreference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values\nwill never be dropped.",

    "title": "Creating a Reference Cycle",
    "content": "Let\u2019s look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it,\nstarting with the definition of the `List` enum and a `tail` method in Listing\n15-25.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-25\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A cons list definition that holds a `RefCell<T>` so that we can modify what a `Cons` variant is referring to\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-25/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019re using another variation of the `List` definition from Listing 15-5. The\nsecond element in the `Cons` variant is now `RefCell<Rc<List>>`, meaning that\ninstead of having the ability to modify the `i32` value as we did in Listing\n15-24, we want to modify the `List` value a `Cons` variant is pointing to.\nWe\u2019re also adding a `tail` method to make it convenient for us to access the\nsecond item if we have a `Cons` variant.\n\nIn Listing 15-26, we\u2019re adding a `main` function that uses the definitions in\nListing 15-25. This code creates a list in `a` and a list in `b` that points to\nthe list in `a`. Then, it modifies the list in `a` to point to `b`, creating a\nreference cycle. There are `println!` statements along the way to show what the\nreference counts are at various points in this process.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-26\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating a reference cycle of two `List` values pointing to each other\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-26/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe create an `Rc<List>` instance holding a `List` value in the variable `a`\nwith an initial list of `5, Nil`. We then create an `Rc<List>` instance holding\nanother `List` value in the variable `b` that contains the value `10` and\npoints to the list in `a`.\n\nWe modify `a` so that it points to `b` instead of `Nil`, creating a cycle. We\ndo that by using the `tail` method to get a reference to the\n`RefCell<Rc<List>>` in `a`, which we put in the variable `link`. Then, we use\nthe `borrow_mut` method on the `RefCell<Rc<List>>` to change the value inside\nfrom an `Rc<List>` that holds a `Nil` value to the `Rc<List>` in `b`.\n\nWhen we run this code, keeping the last `println!` commented out for the\nmoment, we\u2019ll get this output:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-26/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe reference count of the `Rc<List>` instances in both `a` and `b` is 2 after\nwe change the list in `a` to point to `b`. At the end of `main`, Rust drops the\nvariable `b`, which decreases the reference count of the `b` `Rc<List>`\ninstance from 2 to 1. The memory that `Rc<List>` has on the heap won\u2019t be\ndropped at this point because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then, Rust drops\n`a`, which decreases the reference count of the `a` `Rc<List>` instance from 2\nto 1 as well. This instance\u2019s memory can\u2019t be dropped either, because the other\n`Rc<List>` instance still refers to it. The memory allocated to the list will\nremain uncollected forever. To visualize this reference cycle, we\u2019ve created\nthe diagram in Figure 15-4.\n\n<img alt=\"A rectangle labeled 'a' that points to a rectangle containing the integer 5. A rectangle labeled 'b' that points to a rectangle containing the integer 10. The rectangle containing 5 points to the rectangle containing 10, and the rectangle containing 10 points back to the rectangle containing 5, creating a cycle.\" src=\"img/trpl15-04.svg\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 15-4: A reference cycle of lists `a` and `b`\npointing to each other</span>\n\nIf you uncomment the last `println!` and run the program, Rust will try to\nprint this cycle with `a` pointing to `b` pointing to `a` and so forth until it\noverflows the stack.\n\nCompared to a real-world program, the consequences of creating a reference\ncycle in this example aren\u2019t very dire: Right after we create the reference\ncycle, the program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of\nmemory in a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more\nmemory than it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of\navailable memory.\n\nCreating reference cycles is not easily done, but it\u2019s not impossible either.\nIf you have `RefCell<T>` values that contain `Rc<T>` values or similar nested\ncombinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must\nensure that you don\u2019t create cycles; you can\u2019t rely on Rust to catch them.\nCreating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should\nuse automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to\nminimize.\n\nAnother solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data\nstructures so that some references express ownership and some references don\u2019t.\nAs a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership relationships and\nsome non-ownership relationships, and only the ownership relationships affect\nwhether or not a value can be dropped. In Listing 15-25, we always want `Cons`\nvariants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure isn\u2019t possible.\nLet\u2019s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes\nto see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent\nreference cycles.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Preventing Reference Cycles Using `Weak<T>`",
    "content": "So far, we\u2019ve demonstrated that calling `Rc::clone` increases the\n`strong_count` of an `Rc<T>` instance, and an `Rc<T>` instance is only cleaned\nup if its `strong_count` is 0. You can also create a weak reference to the\nvalue within an `Rc<T>` instance by calling `Rc::downgrade` and passing a\nreference to the `Rc<T>`. *Strong references* are how you can share ownership\nof an `Rc<T>` instance. *Weak references* don\u2019t express an ownership\nrelationship, and their count doesn\u2019t affect when an `Rc<T>` instance is\ncleaned up. They won\u2019t cause a reference cycle, because any cycle involving\nsome weak references will be broken once the strong reference count of values\ninvolved is 0.\n\nWhen you call `Rc::downgrade`, you get a smart pointer of type `Weak<T>`.\nInstead of increasing the `strong_count` in the `Rc<T>` instance by 1, calling\n`Rc::downgrade` increases the `weak_count` by 1. The `Rc<T>` type uses\n`weak_count` to keep track of how many `Weak<T>` references exist, similar to\n`strong_count`. The difference is the `weak_count` doesn\u2019t need to be 0 for the\n`Rc<T>` instance to be cleaned up.\n\nBecause the value that `Weak<T>` references might have been dropped, to do\nanything with the value that a `Weak<T>` is pointing to you must make sure the\nvalue still exists. Do this by calling the `upgrade` method on a `Weak<T>`\ninstance, which will return an `Option<Rc<T>>`. You\u2019ll get a result of `Some`\nif the `Rc<T>` value has not been dropped yet and a result of `None` if the\n`Rc<T>` value has been dropped. Because `upgrade` returns an `Option<Rc<T>>`,\nRust will ensure that the `Some` case and the `None` case are handled, and\nthere won\u2019t be an invalid pointer.\n\nAs an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next\nitem, we\u2019ll create a tree whose items know about their child items _and_ their\nparent items.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"creating-a-tree-data-structure-a-node-with-child-nodes\"></a>\n\n#### Creating a Tree Data Structure\n\nTo start, we\u2019ll build a tree with nodes that know about their child nodes.\nWe\u2019ll create a struct named `Node` that holds its own `i32` value as well as\nreferences to its child `Node` values:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-27/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe want a `Node` to own its children, and we want to share that ownership with\nvariables so that we can access each `Node` in the tree directly. To do this,\nwe define the `Vec<T>` items to be values of type `Rc<Node>`. We also want to\nmodify which nodes are children of another node, so we have a `RefCell<T>` in\n`children` around the `Vec<Rc<Node>>`.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll use our struct definition and create one `Node` instance named\n`leaf` with the value `3` and no children, and another instance named `branch`\nwith the value `5` and `leaf` as one of its children, as shown in Listing 15-27.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-27\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating a `leaf` node with no children and a `branch` node with `leaf` as one of its children\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-27/src/main.rs:there}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe clone the `Rc<Node>` in `leaf` and store that in `branch`, meaning the\n`Node` in `leaf` now has two owners: `leaf` and `branch`. We can get from\n`branch` to `leaf` through `branch.children`, but there\u2019s no way to get from\n`leaf` to `branch`. The reason is that `leaf` has no reference to `branch` and\ndoesn\u2019t know they\u2019re related. We want `leaf` to know that `branch` is its\nparent. We\u2019ll do that next.\n\n#### Adding a Reference from a Child to Its Parent\n\nTo make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a `parent` field to\nour `Node` struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of\n`parent` should be. We know it can\u2019t contain an `Rc<T>`, because that would\ncreate a reference cycle with `leaf.parent` pointing to `branch` and\n`branch.children` pointing to `leaf`, which would cause their `strong_count`\nvalues to never be 0.\n\nThinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its\nchildren: If a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as\nwell. However, a child should not own its parent: If we drop a child node, the\nparent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!\n\nSo, instead of `Rc<T>`, we\u2019ll make the type of `parent` use `Weak<T>`,\nspecifically a `RefCell<Weak<Node>>`. Now our `Node` struct definition looks\nlike this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-28/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nA node will be able to refer to its parent node but doesn\u2019t own its parent. In\nListing 15-28, we update `main` to use this new definition so that the `leaf`\nnode will have a way to refer to its parent, `branch`.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-28\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `leaf` node with a weak reference to its parent node, `branch`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-28/src/main.rs:there}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nCreating the `leaf` node looks similar to Listing 15-27 with the exception of\nthe `parent` field: `leaf` starts out without a parent, so we create a new,\nempty `Weak<Node>` reference instance.\n\nAt this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of `leaf` by using\nthe `upgrade` method, we get a `None` value. We see this in the output from the\nfirst `println!` statement:\n\n```text\nleaf parent = None\n```\n\nWhen we create the `branch` node, it will also have a new `Weak<Node>`\nreference in the `parent` field because `branch` doesn\u2019t have a parent node. We\nstill have `leaf` as one of the children of `branch`. Once we have the `Node`\ninstance in `branch`, we can modify `leaf` to give it a `Weak<Node>` reference\nto its parent. We use the `borrow_mut` method on the `RefCell<Weak<Node>>` in\nthe `parent` field of `leaf`, and then we use the `Rc::downgrade` function to\ncreate a `Weak<Node>` reference to `branch` from the `Rc<Node>` in `branch`.\n\nWhen we print the parent of `leaf` again, this time we\u2019ll get a `Some` variant\nholding `branch`: Now `leaf` can access its parent! When we print `leaf`, we\nalso avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow like we had in\nListing 15-26; the `Weak<Node>` references are printed as `(Weak)`:\n\n```text\nleaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },\nchildren: RefCell { value: [Node { value: 3, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },\nchildren: RefCell { value: [] } }] } })\n```\n\nThe lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn\u2019t create a reference\ncycle. We can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling\n`Rc::strong_count` and `Rc::weak_count`.\n\n#### Visualizing Changes to `strong_count` and `weak_count`\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the `strong_count` and `weak_count` values of the `Rc<Node>`\ninstances change by creating a new inner scope and moving the creation of\n`branch` into that scope. By doing so, we can see what happens when `branch` is\ncreated and then dropped when it goes out of scope. The modifications are shown\nin Listing 15-29.\n\n<Listing number=\"15-29\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating `branch` in an inner scope and examining strong and weak reference counts\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-29/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAfter `leaf` is created, its `Rc<Node>` has a strong count of 1 and a weak\ncount of 0. In the inner scope, we create `branch` and associate it with\n`leaf`, at which point when we print the counts, the `Rc<Node>` in `branch`\nwill have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1 (for `leaf.parent` pointing\nto `branch` with a `Weak<Node>`). When we print the counts in `leaf`, we\u2019ll see\nit will have a strong count of 2 because `branch` now has a clone of the\n`Rc<Node>` of `leaf` stored in `branch.children` but will still have a weak\ncount of 0.\n\nWhen the inner scope ends, `branch` goes out of scope and the strong count of\nthe `Rc<Node>` decreases to 0, so its `Node` is dropped. The weak count of 1\nfrom `leaf.parent` has no bearing on whether or not `Node` is dropped, so we\ndon\u2019t get any memory leaks!\n\nIf we try to access the parent of `leaf` after the end of the scope, we\u2019ll get\n`None` again. At the end of the program, the `Rc<Node>` in `leaf` has a strong\ncount of 1 and a weak count of 0 because the variable `leaf` is now the only\nreference to the `Rc<Node>` again.\n\nAll of the logic that manages the counts and value dropping is built into\n`Rc<T>` and `Weak<T>` and their implementations of the `Drop` trait. By\nspecifying that the relationship from a child to its parent should be a\n`Weak<T>` reference in the definition of `Node`, you\u2019re able to have parent\nnodes point to child nodes and vice versa without creating a reference cycle\nand memory leaks.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis chapter covered how to use smart pointers to make different guarantees and\ntrade-offs from those Rust makes by default with regular references. The\n`Box<T>` type has a known size and points to data allocated on the heap. The\n`Rc<T>` type keeps track of the number of references to data on the heap so\nthat the data can have multiple owners. The `RefCell<T>` type with its interior\nmutability gives us a type that we can use when we need an immutable type but\nneed to change an inner value of that type; it also enforces the borrowing\nrules at runtime instead of at compile time.\n\nAlso discussed were the `Deref` and `Drop` traits, which enable a lot of the\nfunctionality of smart pointers. We explored reference cycles that can cause\nmemory leaks and how to prevent them using `Weak<T>`.\n\nIf this chapter has piqued your interest and you want to implement your own\nsmart pointers, check out [\u201cThe Rustonomicon\u201d][nomicon] for more useful\ninformation.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll talk about concurrency in Rust. You\u2019ll even learn about a few new\nsmart pointers.\n\n[nomicon]: ../nomicon/index.html",

    "content": "# Fearless Concurrency\n\nHandling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rust\u2019s\nmajor goals. _Concurrent programming_, in which different parts of a program\nexecute independently, and _parallel programming_, in which different parts of\na program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more\ncomputers take advantage of their multiple processors. Historically,\nprogramming in these contexts has been difficult and error-prone. Rust hopes to\nchange that.\n\nInitially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and preventing\nconcurrency problems were two separate challenges to be solved with different\nmethods. Over time, the team discovered that the ownership and type systems are\na powerful set of tools to help manage memory safety _and_ concurrency\nproblems! By leveraging ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors\nare compile-time errors in Rust rather than runtime errors. Therefore, rather\nthan making you spend lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances\nunder which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to\ncompile and present an error explaining the problem. As a result, you can fix\nyour code while you\u2019re working on it rather than potentially after it has been\nshipped to production. We\u2019ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust _fearless\nconcurrency_. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that is free of\nsubtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.\n\n> Note: For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll refer to many of the problems as\n> _concurrent_ rather than being more precise by saying _concurrent and/or\n> parallel_. For this chapter, please mentally substitute _concurrent and/or\n> parallel_ whenever we use _concurrent_. In the next chapter, where the\n> distinction matters more, we\u2019ll be more specific.\n\nMany languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling\nconcurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for\nmessage-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between\nthreads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable\nstrategy for higher-level languages because a higher-level language promises\nbenefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level\nlanguages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any\ngiven situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware. Therefore, Rust\noffers a variety of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate\nfor your situation and requirements.\n\nHere are the topics we\u2019ll cover in this chapter:\n\n- How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time\n- _Message-passing_ concurrency, where channels send messages between threads\n- _Shared-state_ concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece\n  of data\n- The `Sync` and `Send` traits, which extend Rust\u2019s concurrency guarantees to\n  user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library",

    "content": "## Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously\n\nIn most current operating systems, an executed program\u2019s code is run in a\n_process_, and the operating system will manage multiple processes at once.\nWithin a program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously.\nThe features that run these independent parts are called _threads_. For\nexample, a web server could have multiple threads so that it can respond to\nmore than one request at the same time.\n\nSplitting the computation in your program into multiple threads to run multiple\ntasks at the same time can improve performance, but it also adds complexity.\nBecause threads can run simultaneously, there\u2019s no inherent guarantee about the\norder in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead\nto problems, such as:\n\n- Race conditions, in which threads are accessing data or resources in an\n  inconsistent order\n- Deadlocks, in which two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both\n  threads from continuing\n- Bugs that only happen in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix\n  reliably\n\nRust attempts to mitigate the negative effects of using threads, but\nprogramming in a multithreaded context still takes careful thought and requires\na code structure that is different from that in programs running in a single\nthread.\n\nProgramming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and many\noperating systems provide an API the programming language can call for creating\nnew threads. The Rust standard library uses a _1:1_ model of thread\nimplementation, whereby a program uses one operating system thread per one\nlanguage thread. There are crates that implement other models of threading that\nmake different trade-offs to the 1:1 model. (Rust\u2019s async system, which we will\nsee in the next chapter, provides another approach to concurrency as well.)",

The\nreturn type of `thread::spawn` is `JoinHandle<T>`. A `JoinHandle<T>` is an\nowned value that, when we call the `join` method on it, will wait for its\nthread to finish. Listing 16-2 shows how to use the `JoinHandle<T>` of the\nthread we created in Listing 16-1 and how to call `join` to make sure the\nspawned thread finishes before `main` exits.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Saving a `JoinHandle<T>` from `thread::spawn` to guarantee the thread is run to completion\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-02/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nCalling `join` on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the\nthread represented by the handle terminates. _Blocking_ a thread means that\nthread is prevented from performing work or exiting. Because we\u2019ve put the call\nto `join` after the main thread\u2019s `for` loop, running Listing 16-2 should\nproduce output similar to this:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nhi number 1 from the main thread!\nhi number 2 from the main thread!\nhi number 1 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 3 from the main thread!\nhi number 2 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 4 from the main thread!\nhi number 3 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 4 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 5 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 6 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 7 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 8 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 9 from the spawned thread!\n```\n\nThe two threads continue alternating, but the main thread waits because of the\ncall to `handle.join()` and does not end until the spawned thread is finished.\n\nBut let\u2019s see what happens when we instead move `handle.join()` before the\n`for` loop in `main`, like this:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/no-listing-01-join-too-early/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe main thread will wait for the spawned thread to finish and then run its\n`for` loop, so the output won\u2019t be interleaved anymore, as shown here:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nhi number 1 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 2 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 3 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 4 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 5 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 6 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 7 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 8 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 9 from the spawned thread!\nhi number 1 from the main thread!\nhi number 2 from the main thread!\nhi number 3 from the main thread!\nhi number 4 from the main thread!\n```\n\nSmall details, such as where `join` is called, can affect whether or not your\nthreads run at the same time.",

    "content": "We\u2019ll often use the `move` keyword with closures passed to `thread::spawn`\nbecause the closure will then take ownership of the values it uses from the\nenvironment, thus transferring ownership of those values from one thread to\nanother. In [\u201cCapturing References or Moving Ownership\u201d][capture]<!-- ignore\n--> in Chapter 13, we discussed `move` in the context of closures. Now we\u2019ll\nconcentrate more on the interaction between `move` and `thread::spawn`.\n\nNotice in Listing 16-1 that the closure we pass to `thread::spawn` takes no\narguments: We\u2019re not using any data from the main thread in the spawned\nthread\u2019s code. To use data from the main thread in the spawned thread, the\nspawned thread\u2019s closure must capture the values it needs. Listing 16-3 shows\nan attempt to create a vector in the main thread and use it in the spawned\nthread. However, this won\u2019t work yet, as you\u2019ll see in a moment.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to use a vector created by the main thread in another thread\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-03/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe closure uses `v`, so it will capture `v` and make it part of the closure\u2019s\nenvironment. Because `thread::spawn` runs this closure in a new thread, we\nshould be able to access `v` inside that new thread. But when we compile this\nexample, we get the following error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-03/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust _infers_ how to capture `v`, and because `println!` only needs a reference\nto `v`, the closure tries to borrow `v`. However, there\u2019s a problem: Rust can\u2019t\ntell how long the spawned thread will run, so it doesn\u2019t know whether the\nreference to `v` will always be valid.\n\nListing 16-4 provides a scenario that\u2019s more likely to have a reference to `v`\nthat won\u2019t be valid.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-4\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A thread with a closure that attempts to capture a reference to `v` from a main thread that drops `v`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-04/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf Rust allowed us to run this code, there\u2019s a possibility that the spawned\nthread would be immediately put in the background without running at all. The\nspawned thread has a reference to `v` inside, but the main thread immediately\ndrops `v`, using the `drop` function we discussed in Chapter 15. Then, when the\nspawned thread starts to execute, `v` is no longer valid, so a reference to it\nis also invalid. Oh no!\n\nTo fix the compiler error in Listing 16-3, we can use the error message\u2019s\nadvice:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\nafter automatic regeneration, look at listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-03/output.txt and copy the relevant part\n-->\n\n```text\nhelp: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword\n  |\n6 |     let handle = thread::spawn(move || {\n  |                                ++++\n```\n\nBy adding the `move` keyword before the closure, we force the closure to take\nownership of the values it\u2019s using rather than allowing Rust to infer that it\nshould borrow the values. The modification to Listing 16-3 shown in Listing\n16-5 will compile and run as we intend.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-5\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using the `move` keyword to force a closure to take ownership of the values it uses\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-05/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe might be tempted to try the same thing to fix the code in Listing 16-4 where\nthe main thread called `drop` by using a `move` closure. However, this fix will\nnot work because what Listing 16-4 is trying to do is disallowed for a\ndifferent reason. If we added `move` to the closure, we would move `v` into the\nclosure\u2019s environment, and we could no longer call `drop` on it in the main\nthread. We would get this compiler error instead:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/output-only-01-move-drop/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust\u2019s ownership rules have saved us again! We got an error from the code in\nListing 16-3 because Rust was being conservative and only borrowing `v` for the\nthread, which meant the main thread could theoretically invalidate the spawned\nthread\u2019s reference. By telling Rust to move ownership of `v` to the spawned\nthread, we\u2019re guaranteeing to Rust that the main thread won\u2019t use `v` anymore.\nIf we change Listing 16-4 in the same way, we\u2019re then violating the ownership\nrules when we try to use `v` in the main thread. The `move` keyword overrides\nRust\u2019s conservative default of borrowing; it doesn\u2019t let us violate the\nownership rules.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered what threads are and the methods supplied by the thread\nAPI, let\u2019s look at some situations in which we can use threads.\n\n[capture]: ch13-01-closures.html#capturing-references-or-moving-ownership",

Here\u2019s the idea in a slogan from [the Go language documentation](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency):\n\u201cDo not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.\u201d\n\nTo accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust\u2019s standard library provides an\nimplementation of channels. A _channel_ is a general programming concept by\nwhich data is sent from one thread to another.\n\nYou can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional channel of\nwater, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck\ninto a river, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.\n\nA channel has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter half is\nthe upstream location where you put the rubber duck into the river, and the\nreceiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your\ncode calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and\nanother part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said\nto be _closed_ if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values and\nsend them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and\nprint them out. We\u2019ll be sending simple values between threads using a channel\nto illustrate the feature. Once you\u2019re familiar with the technique, you could\nuse channels for any threads that need to communicate with each other, such as\na chat system or a system where many threads perform parts of a calculation and\nsend the parts to one thread that aggregates the results.\n\nFirst, in Listing 16-6, we\u2019ll create a channel but not do anything with it.\nNote that this won\u2019t compile yet because Rust can\u2019t tell what type of values we\nwant to send over the channel.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-6\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating a channel and assigning the two halves to `tx` and `rx`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-06/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe create a new channel using the `mpsc::channel` function; `mpsc` stands for\n_multiple producer, single consumer_. In short, the way Rust\u2019s standard library\nimplements channels means a channel can have multiple _sending_ ends that\nproduce values but only one _receiving_ end that consumes those values. Imagine\nmultiple streams flowing together into one big river: Everything sent down any\nof the streams will end up in one river at the end. We\u2019ll start with a single\nproducer for now, but we\u2019ll add multiple producers when we get this example\nworking.\n\nThe `mpsc::channel` function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the\nsending end\u2014the transmitter\u2014and the second element of which is the receiving\nend\u2014the receiver. The abbreviations `tx` and `rx` are traditionally used in\nmany fields for _transmitter_ and _receiver_, respectively, so we name our\nvariables as such to indicate each end. We\u2019re using a `let` statement with a\npattern that destructures the tuples; we\u2019ll discuss the use of patterns in\n`let` statements and destructuring in Chapter 19. For now, know that using a\n`let` statement in this way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of\nthe tuple returned by `mpsc::channel`.\n\nLet\u2019s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one\nstring so that the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as\nshown in Listing 16-7. This is like putting a rubber duck in the river upstream\nor sending a chat message from one thread to another.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-7\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption='Moving `tx` to a spawned thread and sending `\"hi\"`'>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-07/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAgain, we\u2019re using `thread::spawn` to create a new thread and then using `move`\nto move `tx` into the closure so that the spawned thread owns `tx`. The spawned\nthread needs to own the transmitter to be able to send messages through the\nchannel.\n\nThe transmitter has a `send` method that takes the value we want to send. The\n`send` method returns a `Result<T, E>` type, so if the receiver has already\nbeen dropped and there\u2019s nowhere to send a value, the send operation will\nreturn an error. In this example, we\u2019re calling `unwrap` to panic in case of an\nerror. But in a real application, we would handle it properly: Return to\nChapter 9 to review strategies for proper error handling.\n\nIn Listing 16-8, we\u2019ll get the value from the receiver in the main thread. This\nis like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the end of the river or\nreceiving a chat message.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption='Receiving the value `\"hi\"` in the main thread and printing it'>\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-08/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe receiver has two useful methods: `recv` and `try_recv`. We\u2019re using `recv`,\nshort for _receive_, which will block the main thread\u2019s execution and wait\nuntil a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is sent, `recv` will\nreturn it in a `Result<T, E>`. When the transmitter closes, `recv` will return\nan error to signal that no more values will be coming.\n\nThe `try_recv` method doesn\u2019t block, but will instead return a `Result<T, E>`\nimmediately: an `Ok` value holding a message if one is available and an `Err`\nvalue if there aren\u2019t any messages this time. Using `try_recv` is useful if\nthis thread has other work to do while waiting for messages: We could write a\nloop that calls `try_recv` every so often, handles a message if one is\navailable, and otherwise does other work for a little while until checking\nagain.\n\nWe\u2019ve used `recv` in this example for simplicity; we don\u2019t have any other work\nfor the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so blocking the main\nthread is appropriate.\n\nWhen we run the code in Listing 16-8, we\u2019ll see the value printed from the main\nthread:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nGot: hi\n```\n\nPerfect!\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "## Shared-State Concurrency\n\nMessage passing is a fine way to handle concurrency, but it\u2019s not the only way.\nAnother method would be for multiple threads to access the same shared data.\nConsider this part of the slogan from the Go language documentation again: \u201cDo\nnot communicate by sharing memory.\u201d\n\nWhat would communicating by sharing memory look like? In addition, why would\nmessage-passing enthusiasts caution not to use memory sharing?\n\nIn a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single ownership\nbecause once you transfer a value down a channel, you should no longer use that\nvalue. Shared-memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: Multiple threads\ncan access the same memory location at the same time. As you saw in Chapter 15,\nwhere smart pointers made multiple ownership possible, multiple ownership can\nadd complexity because these different owners need managing. Rust\u2019s type system\nand ownership rules greatly assist in getting this management correct. For an\nexample, let\u2019s look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives\nfor shared memory.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Controlling Access with Mutexes",
    "content": "_Mutex_ is an abbreviation for _mutual exclusion_, as in a mutex allows only\none thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a\nmutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the\nmutex\u2019s lock. The _lock_ is a data structure that is part of the mutex that\nkeeps track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the\nmutex is described as _guarding_ the data it holds via the locking system.\n\nMutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to\nremember two rules:\n\n1. You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.\n2. When you\u2019re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the\n   data so that other threads can acquire the lock.\n\nFor a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a\nconference with only one microphone. Before a panelist can speak, they have to\nask or signal that they want to use the microphone. When they get the\nmicrophone, they can talk for as long as they want to and then hand the\nmicrophone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to\nhand the microphone off when they\u2019re finished with it, no one else is able to\nspeak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel won\u2019t work\nas planned!\n\nManagement of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why so\nmany people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust\u2019s type\nsystem and ownership rules, you can\u2019t get locking and unlocking wrong.\n\n#### The API of `Mutex<T>`\n\nAs an example of how to use a mutex, let\u2019s start by using a mutex in a\nsingle-threaded context, as shown in Listing 16-12.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-12\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Exploring the API of `Mutex<T>` in a single-threaded context for simplicity\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-12/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAs with many types, we create a `Mutex<T>` using the associated function `new`.\nTo access the data inside the mutex, we use the `lock` method to acquire the\nlock. This call will block the current thread so that it can\u2019t do any work\nuntil it\u2019s our turn to have the lock.\n\nThe call to `lock` would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. In\nthat case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we\u2019ve chosen to\n`unwrap` and have this thread panic if we\u2019re in that situation.\n\nAfter we\u2019ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named `num` in\nthis case, as a mutable reference to the data inside. The type system ensures\nthat we acquire a lock before using the value in `m`. The type of `m` is\n`Mutex<i32>`, not `i32`, so we _must_ call `lock` to be able to use the `i32`\nvalue. We can\u2019t forget; the type system won\u2019t let us access the inner `i32`\notherwise.\n\nThe call to `lock` returns a type called `MutexGuard`, wrapped in a\n`LockResult` that we handled with the call to `unwrap`. The `MutexGuard` type\nimplements `Deref` to point at our inner data; the type also has a `Drop`\nimplementation that releases the lock automatically when a `MutexGuard` goes\nout of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope. As a result, we\ndon\u2019t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex from being\nused by other threads because the lock release happens automatically.\n\nAfter dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we were able\nto change the inner `i32` to `6`.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads\"></a>\n\n#### Shared Access to `Mutex<T>`\n\nNow let\u2019s try to share a value between multiple threads using `Mutex<T>`. We\u2019ll\nspin up 10 threads and have them each increment a counter value by 1, so the\ncounter goes from 0 to 10. The example in Listing 16-13 will have a compiler\nerror, and we\u2019ll use that error to learn more about using `Mutex<T>` and how\nRust helps us use it correctly.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-13\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Ten threads, each incrementing a counter guarded by a `Mutex<T>`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-13/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe create a `counter` variable to hold an `i32` inside a `Mutex<T>`, as we did\nin Listing 16-12. Next, we create 10 threads by iterating over a range of\nnumbers. We use `thread::spawn` and give all the threads the same closure: one\nthat moves the counter into the thread, acquires a lock on the `Mutex<T>` by\ncalling the `lock` method, and then adds 1 to the value in the mutex. When a\nthread finishes running its closure, `num` will go out of scope and release the\nlock so that another thread can acquire it.\n\nIn the main thread, we collect all the join handles. Then, as we did in Listing\n16-2, we call `join` on each handle to make sure all the threads finish. At\nthat point, the main thread will acquire the lock and print the result of this\nprogram.\n\nWe hinted that this example wouldn\u2019t compile. Now let\u2019s find out why!\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-13/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error message states that the `counter` value was moved in the previous\niteration of the loop. Rust is telling us that we can\u2019t move the ownership of\nlock `counter` into multiple threads. Let\u2019s fix the compiler error with the\nmultiple-ownership method we discussed in Chapter 15.\n\n#### Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads\n\nIn Chapter 15, we gave a value to multiple owners by using the smart pointer\n`Rc<T>` to create a reference-counted value. Let\u2019s do the same here and see\nwhat happens. We\u2019ll wrap the `Mutex<T>` in `Rc<T>` in Listing 16-14 and clone\nthe `Rc<T>` before moving ownership to the thread.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-14\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to use `Rc<T>` to allow multiple threads to own the `Mutex<T>`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-14/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOnce again, we compile and get... different errors! The compiler is teaching us\na lot:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-14/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWow, that error message is very wordy! Here\u2019s the important part to focus on:\n`` `Rc<Mutex<i32>>` cannot be sent between threads safely ``. The compiler is\nalso telling us the reason why: `` the trait `Send` is not implemented for\n`Rc<Mutex<i32>>` ``. We\u2019ll talk about `Send` in the next section: It\u2019s one of\nthe traits that ensures that the types we use with threads are meant for use in\nconcurrent situations.\n\nUnfortunately, `Rc<T>` is not safe to share across threads. When `Rc<T>`\nmanages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call to `clone` and\nsubtracts from the count when each clone is dropped. But it doesn\u2019t use any\nconcurrency primitives to make sure that changes to the count can\u2019t be\ninterrupted by another thread. This could lead to wrong counts\u2014subtle bugs that\ncould in turn lead to memory leaks or a value being dropped before we\u2019re done\nwith it. What we need is a type that is exactly like `Rc<T>`, but that makes\nchanges to the reference count in a thread-safe way.\n\n#### Atomic Reference Counting with `Arc<T>`\n\nFortunately, `Arc<T>` _is_ a type like `Rc<T>` that is safe to use in\nconcurrent situations. The _a_ stands for _atomic_, meaning it\u2019s an _atomically\nreference-counted_ type. Atomics are an additional kind of concurrency\nprimitive that we won\u2019t cover in detail here: See the standard library\ndocumentation for [`std::sync::atomic`][atomic]<!-- ignore --> for more\ndetails. At this point, you just need to know that atomics work like primitive\ntypes but are safe to share across threads.\n\nYou might then wonder why all primitive types aren\u2019t atomic and why standard\nlibrary types aren\u2019t implemented to use `Arc<T>` by default. The reason is that\nthread safety comes with a performance penalty that you only want to pay when\nyou really need to. If you\u2019re just performing operations on values within a\nsingle thread, your code can run faster if it doesn\u2019t have to enforce the\nguarantees atomics provide.\n\nLet\u2019s return to our example: `Arc<T>` and `Rc<T>` have the same API, so we fix\nour program by changing the `use` line, the call to `new`, and the call to\n`clone`. The code in Listing 16-15 will finally compile and run.\n\n<Listing number=\"16-15\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using an `Arc<T>` to wrap the `Mutex<T>` to be able to share ownership across multiple threads\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch16-fearless-concurrency/listing-16-15/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print the following:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nResult: 10\n```\n\nWe did it! We counted from 0 to 10, which may not seem very impressive, but it\ndid teach us a lot about `Mutex<T>` and thread safety. You could also use this\nprogram\u2019s structure to do more complicated operations than just incrementing a\ncounter. Using this strategy, you can divide a calculation into independent\nparts, split those parts across threads, and then use a `Mutex<T>` to have each\nthread update the final result with its part.\n\nNote that if you are doing simple numerical operations, there are types simpler\nthan `Mutex<T>` types provided by the [`std::sync::atomic` module of the\nstandard library][atomic]<!-- ignore -->. These types provide safe, concurrent,\natomic access to primitive types. We chose to use `Mutex<T>` with a primitive\ntype for this example so that we could concentrate on how `Mutex<T>` works.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Recall from Chapter 15 that using `Rc<T>` came\nwith the risk of creating reference cycles, where two `Rc<T>` values refer to\neach other, causing memory leaks.

These occur when an operation needs to lock two resources\nand two threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for\neach other forever.

For this reason, `Rc<T>` is implemented\nfor use in single-threaded situations where you don\u2019t want to pay the\nthread-safe performance penalty.\n\nTherefore, Rust\u2019s type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never\naccidentally send an `Rc<T>` value across threads unsafely.

    "content": "# Fundamentals of Asynchronous Programming: Async, Await, Futures, and Streams\n\nMany operations we ask the computer to do can take a while to finish. It would\nbe nice if we could do something else while we\u2019re waiting for those\nlong-running processes to complete. Modern computers offer two techniques for\nworking on more than one operation at a time: parallelism and concurrency. Our\nprograms\u2019 logic, however, is written in a mostly linear fashion. We\u2019d like to\nbe able to specify the operations a program should perform and points at which\na function could pause and some other part of the program could run instead,\nwithout needing to specify up front exactly the order and manner in which each\nbit of code should run. _Asynchronous programming_ is an abstraction that lets\nus express our code in terms of potential pausing points and eventual results\nthat takes care of the details of coordination for us.\n\nThis chapter builds on Chapter 16\u2019s use of threads for parallelism and\nconcurrency by introducing an alternative approach to writing code: Rust\u2019s\nfutures, streams, and the `async` and `await` syntax that let us express how\noperations could be asynchronous, and the third-party crates that implement\nasynchronous runtimes: code that manages and coordinates the execution of\nasynchronous operations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an example. Say you\u2019re exporting a video you\u2019ve created of a\nfamily celebration, an operation that could take anywhere from minutes to\nhours. The video export will use as much CPU and GPU power as it can. If you\nhad only one CPU core and your operating system didn\u2019t pause that export until\nit completed\u2014that is, if it executed the export _synchronously_\u2014you couldn\u2019t do\nanything else on your computer while that task was running. That would be a\npretty frustrating experience. Fortunately, your computer\u2019s operating system\ncan, and does, invisibly interrupt the export often enough to let you get other\nwork done simultaneously.\n\nNow say you\u2019re downloading a video shared by someone else, which can also take\na while but does not take up as much CPU time. In this case, the CPU has to\nwait for data to arrive from the network. While you can start reading the data\nonce it starts to arrive, it might take some time for all of it to show up.\nEven once the data is all present, if the video is quite large, it could take\nat least a second or two to load it all. That might not sound like much, but\nit\u2019s a very long time for a modern processor, which can perform billions of\noperations every second. Again, your operating system will invisibly interrupt\nyour program to allow the CPU to perform other work while waiting for the\nnetwork call to finish.\n\nThe video export is an example of a _CPU-bound_ or _compute-bound_ operation.\nIt\u2019s limited by the computer\u2019s potential data processing speed within the CPU\nor GPU, and how much of that speed it can dedicate to the operation. The video\ndownload is an example of an _I/O-bound_ operation, because it\u2019s limited by the\nspeed of the computer\u2019s _input and output_; it can only go as fast as the data\ncan be sent across the network.\n\nIn both of these examples, the operating system\u2019s invisible interrupts provide\na form of concurrency. That concurrency happens only at the level of the entire\nprogram, though: the operating system interrupts one program to let other\nprograms get work done. In many cases, because we understand our programs at a\nmuch more granular level than the operating system does, we can spot\nopportunities for concurrency that the operating system can\u2019t see.\n\nFor example, if we\u2019re building a tool to manage file downloads, we should be\nable to write our program so that starting one download won\u2019t lock up the UI,\nand users should be able to start multiple downloads at the same time. Many\noperating system APIs for interacting with the network are _blocking_, though;\nthat is, they block the program\u2019s progress until the data they\u2019re processing is\ncompletely ready.\n\n> Note: This is how _most_ function calls work, if you think about it. However,\n> the term _blocking_ is usually reserved for function calls that interact with\n> files, the network, or other resources on the computer, because those are the\n> cases where an individual program would benefit from the operation being\n> _non_-blocking.\n\nWe could avoid blocking our main thread by spawning a dedicated thread to\ndownload each file. However, the overhead of the system resources used by those\nthreads would eventually become a problem. It would be preferable if the call\ndidn\u2019t block in the first place, and instead we could define a number of tasks\nthat we\u2019d like our program to complete and allow the runtime to choose the best\norder and manner in which to run them.\n\nThat is exactly what Rust\u2019s _async_ (short for _asynchronous_) abstraction\ngives us. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn all about async as we cover the\nfollowing topics:\n\n- How to use Rust\u2019s `async` and `await` syntax and execute asynchronous\n  functions with a runtime\n- How to use the async model to solve some of the same challenges we looked at\n  in Chapter 16\n- How multithreading and async provide complementary solutions that you can\n  combine in many cases\n\nBefore we see how async works in practice, though, we need to take a short\ndetour to discuss the differences between parallelism and concurrency.\n\n## Parallelism and Concurrency\n\nWe\u2019ve treated parallelism and concurrency as mostly interchangeable so far. Now\nwe need to distinguish between them more precisely, because the differences\nwill show up as we start working.\n\nConsider the different ways a team could split up work on a software project.\nYou could assign a single member multiple tasks, assign each member one task,\nor use a mix of the two approaches.\n\nWhen an individual works on several different tasks before any of them is\ncomplete, this is _concurrency_. One way to implement concurrency is similar to\nhaving two different projects checked out on your computer, and when you get\nbored or stuck on one project, you switch to the other. You\u2019re just one person,\nso you can\u2019t make progress on both tasks at the exact same time, but you can\nmultitask, making progress on one at a time by switching between them (see\nFigure 17-1).\n\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"img/trpl17-01.svg\" class=\"center\" alt=\"A diagram with stacked boxes labeled Task A and Task B, with diamonds in them representing subtasks. Arrows point from A1 to B1, B1 to A2, A2 to B2, B2 to A3, A3 to A4, and A4 to B3. The arrows between the subtasks cross the boxes between Task A and Task B.\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-1: A concurrent workflow, switching between Task A and Task B</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen the team splits up a group of tasks by having each member take one task\nand work on it alone, this is _parallelism_. Each person on the team can make\nprogress at the exact same time (see Figure 17-2).\n\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"img/trpl17-02.svg\" class=\"center\" alt=\"A diagram with stacked boxes labeled Task A and Task B, with diamonds in them representing subtasks. Arrows point from A1 to A2, A2 to A3, A3 to A4, B1 to B2, and B2 to B3. No arrows cross between the boxes for Task A and Task B.\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-2: A parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn both of these workflows, you might have to coordinate between different\ntasks. Maybe you thought the task assigned to one person was totally\nindependent from everyone else\u2019s work, but it actually requires another person\non the team to finish their task first. Some of the work could be done in\nparallel, but some of it was actually _serial_: it could only happen in a\nseries, one task after the other, as in Figure 17-3.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"img/trpl17-03.svg\" class=\"center\" alt=\"A diagram with stacked boxes labeled Task A and Task B, with diamonds in them representing subtasks. In Task A, arrows point from A1 to A2, from A2 to a pair of thick vertical lines like a \u201cpause\u201d symbol, and from that symbol to A3. In task B, arrows point from B1 to B2, from B2 to B3, from B3 to A3, and from B3 to B4.\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-3: A partially parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently until Task A3 is blocked on the results of Task B3.</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nLikewise, you might realize that one of your own tasks depends on another of\nyour tasks. Now your concurrent work has also become serial.\n\nParallelism and concurrency can intersect with each other, too. If you learn\nthat a colleague is stuck until you finish one of your tasks, you\u2019ll probably\nfocus all your efforts on that task to \u201cunblock\u201d your colleague. You and your\ncoworker are no longer able to work in parallel, and you\u2019re also no longer able\nto work concurrently on your own tasks.\n\nThe same basic dynamics come into play with software and hardware. On a machine\nwith a single CPU core, the CPU can perform only one operation at a time, but\nit can still work concurrently. Using tools such as threads, processes, and\nasync, the computer can pause one activity and switch to others before\neventually cycling back to that first activity again. On a machine with\nmultiple CPU cores, it can also do work in parallel. One core can be performing\none task while another core performs a completely unrelated one, and those\noperations actually happen at the same time.\n\nRunning async code in Rust usually happens concurrently. Depending on the\nhardware, the operating system, and the async runtime we are using (more on\nasync runtimes shortly), that concurrency may also use parallelism under the\nhood.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into how async programming in Rust actually works.",

    "content": "## Futures and the Async Syntax\n\nThe key elements of asynchronous programming in Rust are _futures_ and Rust\u2019s\n`async` and `await` keywords.\n\nA _future_ is a value that may not be ready now but will become ready at some\npoint in the future. (This same concept shows up in many languages, sometimes\nunder other names such as _task_ or _promise_.) Rust provides a `Future` trait\nas a building block so that different async operations can be implemented with\ndifferent data structures but with a common interface. In Rust, futures are\ntypes that implement the `Future` trait. Each future holds its own information\nabout the progress that has been made and what \u201cready\u201d means.\n\nYou can apply the `async` keyword to blocks and functions to specify that they\ncan be interrupted and resumed. Within an async block or async function, you\ncan use the `await` keyword to _await a future_ (that is, wait for it to become\nready). Any point where you await a future within an async block or function is\na potential spot for that block or function to pause and resume. The process of\nchecking with a future to see if its value is available yet is called _polling_.\n\nSome other languages, such as C# and JavaScript, also use `async` and `await`\nkeywords for async programming. If you\u2019re familiar with those languages, you\nmay notice some significant differences in how Rust handles the syntax. That\u2019s\nfor good reason, as we\u2019ll see!\n\nWhen writing async Rust, we use the `async` and `await` keywords most of the\ntime. Rust compiles them into equivalent code using the `Future` trait, much as\nit compiles `for` loops into equivalent code using the `Iterator` trait.\nBecause Rust provides the `Future` trait, though, you can also implement it for\nyour own data types when you need to. Many of the functions we\u2019ll see\nthroughout this chapter return types with their own implementations of\n`Future`. We\u2019ll return to the definition of the trait at the end of the chapter\nand dig into more of how it works, but this is enough detail to keep us moving\nforward.\n\nThis may all feel a bit abstract, so let\u2019s write our first async program: a\nlittle web scraper. We\u2019ll pass in two URLs from the command line, fetch both of\nthem concurrently, and return the result of whichever one finishes first. This\nexample will have a fair bit of new syntax, but don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ll explain\neverything you need to know as we go.\n\n## Our First Async Program\n\nTo keep the focus of this chapter on learning async rather than juggling parts\nof the ecosystem, we\u2019ve created the `trpl` crate (`trpl` is short for \u201cThe Rust\nProgramming Language\u201d). It re-exports all the types, traits, and functions\nyou\u2019ll need, primarily from the [`futures`][futures-crate]<!-- ignore --> and\n[`tokio`][tokio]<!-- ignore --> crates. The `futures` crate is an official home\nfor Rust experimentation for async code, and it\u2019s actually where the `Future`\ntrait was originally designed. Tokio is the most widely used async runtime in\nRust today, especially for web applications. There are other great runtimes out\nthere, and they may be more suitable for your purposes. We use the `tokio`\ncrate under the hood for `trpl` because it\u2019s well tested and widely used.\n\nIn some cases, `trpl` also renames or wraps the original APIs to keep you\nfocused on the details relevant to this chapter. If you want to understand what\nthe crate does, we encourage you to check out [its source code][crate-source].\nYou\u2019ll be able to see what crate each re-export comes from, and we\u2019ve left\nextensive comments explaining what the crate does.\n\nCreate a new binary project named `hello-async` and add the `trpl` crate as a\ndependency:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new hello-async\n$ cd hello-async\n$ cargo add trpl\n```\n\nNow we can use the various pieces provided by `trpl` to write our first async\nprogram. We\u2019ll build a little command line tool that fetches two web pages,\npulls the `<title>` element from each, and prints out the title of whichever\npage finishes that whole process first.",

    "content": "Let\u2019s start by writing a function that takes one page URL as a parameter, makes\na request to it, and returns the text of the `<title>` element (see Listing\n17-1).\n\n<Listing number=\"17-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Defining an async function to get the title element from an HTML page\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-01/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we define a function named `page_title` and mark it with the `async`\nkeyword. Then we use the `trpl::get` function to fetch whatever URL is passed\nin and add the `await` keyword to await the response. To get the text of the\n`response`, we call its `text` method and once again await it with the `await`\nkeyword. Both of these steps are asynchronous. For the `get` function, we have\nto wait for the server to send back the first part of its response, which will\ninclude HTTP headers, cookies, and so on and can be delivered separately from\nthe response body. Especially if the body is very large, it can take some time\nfor it all to arrive. Because we have to wait for the _entirety_ of the\nresponse to arrive, the `text` method is also async.\n\nWe have to explicitly await both of these futures, because futures in Rust are\n_lazy_: they don\u2019t do anything until you ask them to with the `await` keyword.\n(In fact, Rust will show a compiler warning if you don\u2019t use a future.) This\nmight remind you of the discussion of iterators in the [\u201cProcessing a Series of\nItems with Iterators\u201d][iterators-lazy]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 13.\nIterators do nothing unless you call their `next` method\u2014whether directly or by\nusing `for` loops or methods such as `map` that use `next` under the hood.\nLikewise, futures do nothing unless you explicitly ask them to. This laziness\nallows Rust to avoid running async code until it\u2019s actually needed.\n\n> Note: This is different from the behavior we saw when using `thread::spawn`\n> in the [\u201cCreating a New Thread with spawn\u201d][thread-spawn]<!-- ignore -->\n> section in Chapter 16, where the closure we passed to another thread started\n> running immediately. It\u2019s also different from how many other languages\n> approach async. But it\u2019s important for Rust to be able to provide its\n> performance guarantees, just as it is with iterators.\n\nOnce we have `response_text`, we can parse it into an instance of the `Html`\ntype using `Html::parse`. Instead of a raw string, we now have a data type we\ncan use to work with the HTML as a richer data structure. In particular, we can\nuse the `select_first` method to find the first instance of a given CSS\nselector. By passing the string `\"title\"`, we\u2019ll get the first `<title>`\nelement in the document, if there is one. Because there may not be any matching\nelement, `select_first` returns an `Option<ElementRef>`. Finally, we use the\n`Option::map` method, which lets us work with the item in the `Option` if it\u2019s\npresent, and do nothing if it isn\u2019t. (We could also use a `match` expression\nhere, but `map` is more idiomatic.) In the body of the function we supply to\n`map`, we call `inner_html` on the `title` to get its content, which is a\n`String`. When all is said and done, we have an `Option<String>`.\n\nNotice that Rust\u2019s `await` keyword goes _after_ the expression you\u2019re awaiting,\nnot before it. That is, it\u2019s a _postfix_ keyword. This may differ from what\nyou\u2019re used to if you\u2019ve used `async` in other languages, but in Rust it makes\nchains of methods much nicer to work with. As a result, we could change the\nbody of `page_title` to chain the `trpl::get` and `text` function calls\ntogether with `await` between them, as shown in Listing 17-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Chaining with the `await` keyword\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-02/src/main.rs:chaining}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWith that, we have successfully written our first async function! Before we add\nsome code in `main` to call it, let\u2019s talk a little more about what we\u2019ve\nwritten and what it means.\n\nWhen Rust sees a _block_ marked with the `async` keyword, it compiles it into a\nunique, anonymous data type that implements the `Future` trait. When Rust sees\na _function_ marked with `async`, it compiles it into a non-async function\nwhose body is an async block. An async function\u2019s return type is the type of\nthe anonymous data type the compiler creates for that async block.\n\nThus, writing `async fn` is equivalent to writing a function that returns a\n_future_ of the return type. To the compiler, a function definition such as the\n`async fn page_title` in Listing 17-1 is roughly equivalent to a non-async\nfunction defined like this:\n\n```rust\n# extern crate trpl; // required for mdbook test\nuse std::future::Future;\nuse trpl::Html;\n\nfn page_title(url: &str) -> impl Future<Output = Option<String>> {\n    async move {\n        let text = trpl::get(url).await.text().await;\n        Html::parse(&text)\n            .select_first(\"title\")\n            .map(|title| title.inner_html())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each part of the transformed version:\n\n- It uses the `impl Trait` syntax we discussed back in Chapter 10 in the\n  [\u201cTraits as Parameters\u201d][impl-trait]<!-- ignore --> section.\n- The returned value implements the `Future` trait with an associated type of\n  `Output`. Notice that the `Output` type is `Option<String>`, which is the\n  same as the original return type from the `async fn` version of `page_title`.\n- All of the code called in the body of the original function is wrapped in\n  an `async move` block. Remember that blocks are expressions. This whole block\n  is the expression returned from the function.\n- This async block produces a value with the type `Option<String>`, as just\n  described. That value matches the `Output` type in the return type. This is\n  just like other blocks you have seen.\n- The new function body is an `async move` block because of how it uses the\n  `url` parameter. (We\u2019ll talk much more about `async` versus `async move`\n  later in the chapter.)\n\nNow we can call `page_title` in `main`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

A\nprogram\u2019s `main` function can _initialize_ a runtime, but it\u2019s not a runtime\n_itself_. (We\u2019ll see more about why this is the case in a bit.) Every Rust\nprogram that executes async code has at least one place where it sets up a\nruntime that executes the futures.\n\nMost languages that support async bundle a runtime, but Rust does not. Instead,\nthere are many different async runtimes available, each of which makes different\ntradeoffs suitable to the use case it targets. For example, a high-throughput\nweb server with many CPU cores and a large amount of RAM has very different\nneeds than a microcontroller with a single core, a small amount of RAM, and no\nheap allocation ability. The crates that provide those runtimes also often\nsupply async versions of common functionality such as file or network I/O.\n\nHere, and throughout the rest of this chapter, we\u2019ll use the `block_on`\nfunction from the `trpl` crate, which takes a future as an argument and blocks\nthe current thread until this future runs to completion. Behind the scenes,\ncalling `block_on` sets up a runtime using the `tokio` crate that\u2019s used to run\nthe future passed in (the `trpl` crate\u2019s `block_on` behavior is similar to\nother runtime crates\u2019 `block_on` functions). Once the future completes,\n`block_on` returns whatever value the future produced.\n\nWe could pass the future returned by `page_title` directly to `block_on` and,\nonce it completed, we could match on the resulting `Option<String>` as we tried\nto do in Listing 17-3. However, for most of the examples in the chapter (and\nmost async code in the real world), we\u2019ll be doing more than just one async\nfunction call, so instead we\u2019ll pass an `async` block and explicitly await the\nresult of the `page_title` call, as in Listing 17-4.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-4\" caption=\"Awaiting an async block with `trpl::block_on`\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n<!-- should_panic,noplayground because mdbook test does not pass args -->\n\n```rust,should_panic,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-04/src/main.rs:run}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we run this code, we get the behavior we expected initially:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-04\ncargo build # skip all the build noise\ncargo run -- \"https://www.rust-lang.org\"\n# copy the output here\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run -- \"https://www.rust-lang.org\"\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s\n     Running `target/debug/async_await 'https://www.rust-lang.org'`\nThe title for https://www.rust-lang.org was\n            Rust Programming Language\n```\n\nPhew\u2014we finally have some working async code! But before we add the code to\nrace two sites against each other, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention back to how\nfutures work.\n\nEach _await point_\u2014that is, every place where the code uses the `await`\nkeyword\u2014represents a place where control is handed back to the runtime. To make\nthat work, Rust needs to keep track of the state involved in the async block so\nthat the runtime could kick off some other work and then come back when it\u2019s\nready to try advancing the first one again. This is an invisible state machine,\nas if you\u2019d written an enum like this to save the current state at each await\npoint:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/no-listing-state-machine/src/lib.rs:enum}}\n```\n\nWriting the code to transition between each state by hand would be tedious and\nerror-prone, however, especially when you need to add more functionality and\nmore states to the code later. Fortunately, the Rust compiler creates and\nmanages the state machine data structures for async code automatically. The\nnormal borrowing and ownership rules around data structures all still apply,\nand happily, the compiler also handles checking those for us and provides\nuseful error messages. We\u2019ll work through a few of those later in the chapter.\n\nUltimately, something has to execute this state machine, and that something is\na runtime. (This is why you may come across mentions of _executors_ when\nlooking into runtimes: an executor is the part of a runtime responsible for\nexecuting the async code.)\n\nNow you can see why the compiler stopped us from making `main` itself an async\nfunction back in Listing 17-3. If `main` were an async function, something else\nwould need to manage the state machine for whatever future `main` returned, but\n`main` is the starting point for the program! Instead, we called the\n`trpl::block_on` function in `main` to set up a runtime and run the future\nreturned by the `async` block until it\u2019s done.\n\n> Note: Some runtimes provide macros so you _can_ write an async `main`\n> function. Those macros rewrite `async fn main() { ... }` to be a normal `fn\n> main`, which does the same thing we did by hand in Listing 17-4: call a\n> function that runs a future to completion the way `trpl::block_on` does.\n\nNow let\u2019s put these pieces together and see how we can write concurrent code.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Then\nwe pass the futures to `trpl::select`, which returns a value to indicate which\nof the futures passed to it finishes first.\n\n> Note: Under the hood, `trpl::select` is built on a more general `select`\n> function defined in the `futures` crate. The `futures` crate\u2019s `select`\n> function can do a lot of things that the `trpl::select` function can\u2019t, but\n> it also has some additional complexity that we can skip over for now.\n\nEither future can legitimately \u201cwin,\u201d so it doesn\u2019t make sense to return a\n`Result`. Instead, `trpl::select` returns a type we haven\u2019t seen before,\n`trpl::Either`. The `Either` type is somewhat similar to a `Result` in that it\nhas two cases. Unlike `Result`, though, there is no notion of success or\nfailure baked into `Either`. Instead, it uses `Left` and `Right` to indicate\n\u201cone or the other\u201d:\n\n```rust\nenum Either<A, B> {\n    Left(A),\n    Right(B),\n}\n```\n\nThe `select` function returns `Left` with that future\u2019s output if the first\nargument wins, and `Right` with the second future argument\u2019s output if _that_\none wins. This matches the order the arguments appear in when calling the\nfunction: the first argument is to the left of the second argument.\n\nWe also update `page_title` to return the same URL passed in. That way, if the\npage that returns first does not have a `<title>` we can resolve, we can still\nprint a meaningful message.

Because we already talked about a lot of\nthe key ideas there, in this section we\u2019ll focus on what\u2019s different between\nthreads and futures.\n\nIn many cases, the APIs for working with concurrency using async are very\nsimilar to those for using threads. In other cases, they end up being quite\ndifferent. Even when the APIs _look_ similar between threads and async, they\noften have different behavior\u2014and they nearly always have different performance\ncharacteristics.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "The first operation we tackled in the [\u201cCreating a New Thread with\n`spawn`\u201d][thread-spawn]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 16 was counting up on\ntwo separate threads. Let\u2019s do the same using async. The `trpl` crate supplies\na `spawn_task` function that looks very similar to the `thread::spawn` API, and\na `sleep` function that is an async version of the `thread::sleep` API. We can\nuse these together to implement the counting example, as shown in Listing 17-6.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-6\" caption=\"Creating a new task to print one thing while the main task prints something else\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-06/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAs our starting point, we set up our `main` function with `trpl::block_on` so\nthat our top-level function can be async.\n\n> Note: From this point forward in the chapter, every example will include this\n> exact same wrapping code with `trpl::block_on` in `main`, so we\u2019ll often skip it\n> just as we do with `main`. Remember to include it in your code!\n\nThen we write two loops within that block, each containing a `trpl::sleep`\ncall, which waits for half a second (500 milliseconds) before sending the next\nmessage. We put one loop in the body of a `trpl::spawn_task` and the other in a\ntop-level `for` loop. We also add an `await` after the `sleep` calls.\n\nThis code behaves similarly to the thread-based implementation\u2014including the\nfact that you may see the messages appear in a different order in your own\nterminal when you run it:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nhi number 1 from the second task!\nhi number 1 from the first task!\nhi number 2 from the first task!\nhi number 2 from the second task!\nhi number 3 from the first task!\nhi number 3 from the second task!\nhi number 4 from the first task!\nhi number 4 from the second task!\nhi number 5 from the first task!\n```\n\nThis version stops as soon as the `for` loop in the body of the main async\nblock finishes, because the task spawned by `spawn_task` is shut down when the\n`main` function ends. If you want it to run all the way to the task\u2019s\ncompletion, you will need to use a join handle to wait for the first task to\ncomplete. With threads, we used the `join` method to \u201cblock\u201d until the thread\nwas done running. In Listing 17-7, we can use `await` to do the same thing,\nbecause the task handle itself is a future. Its `Output` type is a `Result`, so\nwe also unwrap it after awaiting it.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-7\" caption=\"Using `await` with a join handle to run a task to completion\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-07/src/main.rs:handle}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis updated version runs until _both_ loops finish:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nhi number 1 from the second task!\nhi number 1 from the first task!\nhi number 2 from the first task!\nhi number 2 from the second task!\nhi number 3 from the first task!\nhi number 3 from the second task!\nhi number 4 from the first task!\nhi number 4 from the second task!\nhi number 5 from the first task!\nhi number 6 from the first task!\nhi number 7 from the first task!\nhi number 8 from the first task!\nhi number 9 from the first task!\n```\n\nSo far, it looks like async and threads give us similar outcomes, just with\ndifferent syntax: using `await` instead of calling `join` on the join handle,\nand awaiting the `sleep` calls.\n\nThe bigger difference is that we didn\u2019t need to spawn another operating system\nthread to do this. In fact, we don\u2019t even need to spawn a task here. Because\nasync blocks compile to anonymous futures, we can put each loop in an async\nblock and have the runtime run them both to completion using the `trpl::join`\nfunction.\n\nIn the [\u201cWaiting for All Threads to Finish\u201d][join-handles]<!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 16, we showed how to use the `join` method on the\n`JoinHandle` type returned when you call `std::thread::spawn`. The `trpl::join`\nfunction is similar, but for futures. When you give it two futures, it produces\na single new future whose output is a tuple containing the output of each\nfuture you passed in once they _both_ complete. Thus, in Listing 17-8, we use\n`trpl::join` to wait for both `fut1` and `fut2` to finish. We do _not_ await\n`fut1` and `fut2` but instead the new future produced by `trpl::join`. We\nignore the output, because it\u2019s just a tuple containing two unit values.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-8\" caption=\"Using `trpl::join` to await two anonymous futures\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-08/src/main.rs:join}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we run this, we see both futures run to completion:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nhi number 1 from the first task!\nhi number 1 from the second task!\nhi number 2 from the first task!\nhi number 2 from the second task!\nhi number 3 from the first task!\nhi number 3 from the second task!\nhi number 4 from the first task!\nhi number 4 from the second task!\nhi number 5 from the first task!\nhi number 6 from the first task!\nhi number 7 from the first task!\nhi number 8 from the first task!\nhi number 9 from the first task!\n```\n\nNow, you\u2019ll see the exact same order every time, which is very different from\nwhat we saw with threads and with `trpl::spawn_task` in Listing 17-7. That is\nbecause the `trpl::join` function is _fair_, meaning it checks each future\nequally often, alternating between them, and never lets one race ahead if the\nother is ready. With threads, the operating system decides which thread to\ncheck and how long to let it run. With async Rust, the runtime decides which\ntask to check. (In practice, the details get complicated because an async\nruntime might use operating system threads under the hood as part of how it\nmanages concurrency, so guaranteeing fairness can be more work for a\nruntime\u2014but it\u2019s still possible!) Runtimes don\u2019t have to guarantee fairness for\nany given operation, and they often offer different APIs to let you choose\nwhether or not you want fairness.\n\nTry some of these variations on awaiting the futures and see what they do:\n\n- Remove the async block from around either or both of the loops.\n- Await each async block immediately after defining it.\n- Wrap only the first loop in an async block, and await the resulting future\n  after the body of second loop.\n\nFor an extra challenge, see if you can figure out what the output will be in\neach case _before_ running the code!\n\n<!-- Old headings.

We\u2019ll take\na slightly different path than we did in the [\u201cTransfer Data Between Threads\nwith Message Passing\u201d][message-passing-threads]<!-- ignore --> section in\nChapter 16 to illustrate some of the key differences between thread-based and\nfutures-based concurrency. In Listing 17-9, we\u2019ll begin with just a single\nasync block\u2014_not_ spawning a separate task as we spawned a separate thread.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-9\" caption=\"Creating an async channel and assigning the two halves to `tx` and `rx`\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-09/src/main.rs:channel}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we use `trpl::channel`, an async version of the multiple-producer,\nsingle-consumer channel API we used with threads back in Chapter 16. The async\nversion of the API is only a little different from the thread-based version: it\nuses a mutable rather than an immutable receiver `rx`, and its `recv` method\nproduces a future we need to await rather than producing the value directly.\nNow we can send messages from the sender to the receiver. Notice that we don\u2019t\nhave to spawn a separate thread or even a task; we merely need to await the\n`rx.recv` call.\n\nThe synchronous `Receiver::recv` method in `std::mpsc::channel` blocks until it\nreceives a message. The `trpl::Receiver::recv` method does not, because it is\nasync. Instead of blocking, it hands control back to the runtime until either a\nmessage is received or the send side of the channel closes. By contrast, we\ndon\u2019t await the `send` call, because it doesn\u2019t block. It doesn\u2019t need to,\nbecause the channel we\u2019re sending it into is unbounded.\n\n> Note: Because all of this async code runs in an async block in a\n> `trpl::block_on` call, everything within it can avoid blocking. However, the\n> code _outside_ it will block on the `block_on` function returning. That\u2019s the\n> whole point of the `trpl::block_on` function: it lets you _choose_ where to\n> block on some set of async code, and thus where to transition between sync\n> and async code.\n\nNotice two things about this example. First, the message will arrive right\naway. Second, although we use a future here, there\u2019s no concurrency yet.\nEverything in the listing happens in sequence, just as it would if there were\nno futures involved.\n\nLet\u2019s address the first part by sending a series of messages and sleeping in\nbetween them, as shown in Listing 17-10.\n\n<!-- We cannot test this one because it never stops! -->\n\n<Listing number=\"17-10\" caption=\"Sending and receiving multiple messages over the async channel and sleeping with an `await` between each message\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-10/src/main.rs:many-messages}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn addition to sending the messages, we need to receive them. In this case,\nbecause we know how many messages are coming in, we could do that manually by\ncalling `rx.recv().await` four times. In the real world, though, we\u2019ll generally\nbe waiting on some _unknown_ number of messages, so we need to keep waiting\nuntil we determine that there are no more messages.\n\nIn Listing 16-10, we used a `for` loop to process all the items received from a\nsynchronous channel. Rust doesn\u2019t yet have a way to use a `for` loop with an\n_asynchronously produced_ series of items, however, so we need to use a loop we\nhaven\u2019t seen before: the `while let` conditional loop. This is the loop version\nof the `if let` construct we saw back in the [\u201cConcise Control Flow with `if\nlet` and `let...else`\u201d][if-let]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 6. The loop\nwill continue executing as long as the pattern it specifies continues to match\nthe value.\n\nThe `rx.recv` call produces a future, which we await. The runtime will pause\nthe future until it is ready. Once a message arrives, the future will resolve\nto `Some(message)` as many times as a message arrives. When the channel closes,\nregardless of whether _any_ messages have arrived, the future will instead\nresolve to `None` to indicate that there are no more values and thus we should\nstop polling\u2014that is, stop awaiting.\n\nThe `while let` loop pulls all of this together. If the result of calling\n`rx.recv().await` is `Some(message)`, we get access to the message and we can\nuse it in the loop body, just as we could with `if let`. If the result is\n`None`, the loop ends. Every time the loop completes, it hits the await point\nagain, so the runtime pauses it again until another message arrives.\n\nThe code now successfully sends and receives all of the messages.\nUnfortunately, there are still a couple of problems. For one thing, the\nmessages do not arrive at half-second intervals. They arrive all at once, 2\nseconds (2,000 milliseconds) after we start the program. For another, this\nprogram also never exits! Instead, it waits forever for new messages. You will\nneed to shut it down using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.\n\n#### Code Within One Async Block Executes Linearly\n\nLet\u2019s start by examining why the messages come in all at once after the full\ndelay, rather than coming in with delays between each one. Within a given async\nblock, the order in which `await` keywords appear in the code is also the order\nin which they\u2019re executed when the program runs.\n\nThere\u2019s only one async block in Listing 17-10, so everything in it runs\nlinearly. There\u2019s still no concurrency. All the `tx.send` calls happen,\ninterspersed with all of the `trpl::sleep` calls and their associated await\npoints. Only then does the `while let` loop get to go through any of the\n`await` points on the `recv` calls.\n\nTo get the behavior we want, where the sleep delay happens between each\nmessage, we need to put the `tx` and `rx` operations in their own async blocks,\nas shown in Listing 17-11. Then the runtime can execute each of them separately\nusing `trpl::join`, just as in Listing 17-8. Once again, we await the result of\ncalling `trpl::join`, not the individual futures. If we awaited the individual\nfutures in sequence, we would just end up back in a sequential flow\u2014exactly\nwhat we\u2019re trying _not_ to do.\n\n<!-- We cannot test this one because it never stops! -->\n\n<Listing number=\"17-11\" caption=\"Separating `send` and `recv` into their own `async` blocks and awaiting the futures for those blocks\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-11/src/main.rs:futures}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWith the updated code in Listing 17-11, the messages get printed at\n500-millisecond intervals, rather than all in a rush after 2 seconds.\n\n#### Moving Ownership Into an Async Block\n\nThe program still never exits, though, because of the way the `while let` loop\ninteracts with `trpl::join`:\n\n- The future returned from `trpl::join` completes only once _both_ futures\n  passed to it have completed.\n- The `tx_fut` future completes once it finishes sleeping after sending the last\n  message in `vals`.\n- The `rx_fut` future won\u2019t complete until the `while let` loop ends.\n- The `while let` loop won\u2019t end until awaiting `rx.recv` produces `None`.\n- Awaiting `rx.recv` will return `None` only once the other end of the channel\n  is closed.\n- The channel will close only if we call `rx.close` or when the sender side,\n  `tx`, is dropped.\n- We don\u2019t call `rx.close` anywhere, and `tx` won\u2019t be dropped until the\n  outermost async block passed to `trpl::block_on` ends.\n- The block can\u2019t end because it is blocked on `trpl::join` completing, which\n  takes us back to the top of this list.\n\nRight now, the async block where we send the messages only _borrows_ `tx`\nbecause sending a message doesn\u2019t require ownership, but if we could _move_\n`tx` into that async block, it would be dropped once that block ends. In the\n[\u201cCapturing References or Moving Ownership\u201d][capture-or-move]<!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 13, you learned how to use the `move` keyword with closures,\nand, as discussed in the [\u201cUsing `move` Closures with\nThreads\u201d][move-threads]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 16, we often need to\nmove data into closures when working with threads. The same basic dynamics\napply to async blocks, so the `move` keyword works with async blocks just as it\ndoes with closures.\n\nIn Listing 17-12, we change the block used to send messages from `async` to\n`async move`.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-12\" caption=\"A revision of the code from Listing 17-11 that correctly shuts down when complete\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-12/src/main.rs:with-move}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we run _this_ version of the code, it shuts down gracefully after the last\nmessage is sent and received. Next, let\u2019s see what would need to change to send\ndata from more than one future.\n\n#### Joining a Number of Futures with the `join!` Macro\n\nThis async channel is also a multiple-producer channel, so we can call `clone`\non `tx` if we want to send messages from multiple futures, as shown in Listing\n17-13.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-13\" caption=\"Using multiple producers with async blocks\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-13/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we clone `tx`, creating `tx1` outside the first async block. We move\n`tx1` into that block just as we did before with `tx`. Then, later, we move the\noriginal `tx` into a _new_ async block, where we send more messages on a\nslightly slower delay. We happen to put this new async block after the async\nblock for receiving messages, but it could go before it just as well. The key is\nthe order in which the futures are awaited, not in which they\u2019re created.\n\nBoth of the async blocks for sending messages need to be `async move` blocks so\nthat both `tx` and `tx1` get dropped when those blocks finish. Otherwise, we\u2019ll\nend up back in the same infinite loop we started out in.\n\nFinally, we switch from `trpl::join` to `trpl::join!` to handle the additional\nfuture: the `join!` macro awaits an arbitrary number of futures where we know\nthe number of futures at compile time. We\u2019ll discuss awaiting a collection of\nan unknown number of futures later in this chapter.\n\nNow we see all the messages from both sending futures, and because the sending\nfutures use slightly different delays after sending, the messages are also\nreceived at those different intervals:\n\n<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;\nthe changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than\nchanges in the compiler -->\n\n```text\nreceived 'hi'\nreceived 'more'\nreceived 'from'\nreceived 'the'\nreceived 'messages'\nreceived 'future'\nreceived 'for'\nreceived 'you'\n```\n\nWe\u2019ve explored how to use message passing to send data between futures, how\ncode within an async block runs sequentially, how to move ownership into an\nasync block, and how to join multiple futures. Next, let\u2019s discuss how and why\nto tell the runtime it can switch to another task.\n\n[thread-spawn]: ch16-01-threads.html#creating-a-new-thread-with-spawn\n[join-handles]: ch16-01-threads.html#waiting-for-all-threads-to-finish\n[message-passing-threads]: ch16-02-message-passing.html\n[if-let]: ch06-03-if-let.html\n[capture-or-move]: ch13-01-closures.html#capturing-references-or-moving-ownership\n[move-threads]: ch16-01-threads.html#using-move-closures-with-threads",

The\ninverse is also true: Rust _only_ pauses async blocks and hands control back to\na runtime at an await point. Everything between await points is synchronous.\n\nThat means if you do a bunch of work in an async block without an await point,\nthat future will block any other futures from making progress. You may sometimes\nhear this referred to as one future _starving_ other futures. In some cases,\nthat may not be a big deal. However, if you are doing some kind of expensive\nsetup or long-running work, or if you have a future that will keep doing some\nparticular task indefinitely, you\u2019ll need to think about when and where to hand\ncontrol back to the runtime.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate a long-running operation to illustrate the starvation problem,\nthen explore how to solve it. Listing 17-14 introduces a `slow` function.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-14\" caption=\"Using `thread::sleep` to simulate slow operations\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-14/src/main.rs:slow}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code uses `std::thread::sleep` instead of `trpl::sleep` so that calling\n`slow` will block the current thread for some number of milliseconds. We can\nuse `slow` to stand in for real-world operations that are both long-running and\nblocking.\n\nIn Listing 17-15, we use `slow` to emulate doing this kind of CPU-bound work in\na pair of futures.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-15\" caption=\"Calling the `slow` function to simulate slow operations\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-15/src/main.rs:slow-futures}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nEach future hands control back to the runtime only _after_ carrying out a bunch\nof slow operations. If you run this code, you will see this output:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-15/\ncargo run\ncopy just the output\n-->\n\n```text\n'a' started.\n'a' ran for 30ms\n'a' ran for 10ms\n'a' ran for 20ms\n'b' started.\n'b' ran for 75ms\n'b' ran for 10ms\n'b' ran for 15ms\n'b' ran for 350ms\n'a' finished.\n```\n\nAs with Listing 17-5 where we used `trpl::select` to race futures fetching two\nURLs, `select` still finishes as soon as `a` is done. There\u2019s no interleaving\nbetween the calls to `slow` in the two futures, though. The `a` future does all\nof its work until the `trpl::sleep` call is awaited, then the `b` future does\nall of its work until its own `trpl::sleep` call is awaited, and finally the\n`a` future completes. To allow both futures to make progress between their slow\ntasks, we need await points so we can hand control back to the runtime. That\nmeans we need something we can await!\n\nWe can already see this kind of handoff happening in Listing 17-15: if we\nremoved the `trpl::sleep` at the end of the `a` future, it would complete\nwithout the `b` future running _at all_. Let\u2019s try using the `trpl::sleep`\nfunction as a starting point for letting operations switch off making progress,\nas shown in Listing 17-16.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-16\" caption=\"Using `trpl::sleep` to let operations switch off making progress\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-16/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve added `trpl::sleep` calls with await points between each call to `slow`.\nNow the two futures\u2019 work is interleaved:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-16\ncargo run\ncopy just the output\n-->\n\n```text\n'a' started.\n'a' ran for 30ms\n'b' started.\n'b' ran for 75ms\n'a' ran for 10ms\n'b' ran for 10ms\n'a' ran for 20ms\n'b' ran for 15ms\n'a' finished.\n```\n\nThe `a` future still runs for a bit before handing off control to `b`, because\nit calls `slow` before ever calling `trpl::sleep`, but after that the futures\nswap back and forth each time one of them hits an await point. In this case, we\nhave done that after every call to `slow`, but we could break up the work in\nwhatever way makes the most sense to us.\n\nWe don\u2019t really want to _sleep_ here, though: we want to make progress as fast\nas we can. We just need to hand back control to the runtime. We can do that\ndirectly, using the `trpl::yield_now` function. In Listing 17-17, we replace\nall those `trpl::sleep` calls with `trpl::yield_now`.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-17\" caption=\"Using `yield_now` to let operations switch off making progress\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-17/src/main.rs:yields}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code is both clearer about the actual intent and can be significantly\nfaster than using `sleep`, because timers such as the one used by `sleep` often\nhave limits on how granular they can be. The version of `sleep` we are using,\nfor example, will always sleep for at least a millisecond, even if we pass it a\n`Duration` of one nanosecond. Again, modern computers are _fast_: they can do a\nlot in one millisecond!\n\nThis means that async can be useful even for compute-bound tasks, depending on\nwhat else your program is doing, because it provides a useful tool for\nstructuring the relationships between different parts of the program (but at a\ncost of the overhead of the async state machine). This is a form of\n_cooperative multitasking_, where each future has the power to determine when\nit hands over control via await points. Each future therefore also has the\nresponsibility to avoid blocking for too long. In some Rust-based embedded\noperating systems, this is the _only_ kind of multitasking!\n\nIn real-world code, you won\u2019t usually be alternating function calls with await\npoints on every single line, of course. While yielding control in this way is\nrelatively inexpensive, it\u2019s not free. In many cases, trying to break up a\ncompute-bound task might make it significantly slower, so sometimes it\u2019s better\nfor _overall_ performance to let an operation block briefly. Always\nmeasure to see what your code\u2019s actual performance bottlenecks are. The\nunderlying dynamic is important to keep in mind, though, if you _are_ seeing a\nlot of work happening in serial that you expected to happen concurrently!",

    "content": "We can also compose futures together to create new patterns. For example, we can\nbuild a `timeout` function with async building blocks we already have. When\nwe\u2019re done, the result will be another building block we could use to create\nstill more async abstractions.\n\nListing 17-18 shows how we would expect this `timeout` to work with a slow\nfuture.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-18\" caption=\"Using our imagined `timeout` to run a slow operation with a time limit\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-18/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s implement this! To begin, let\u2019s think about the API for `timeout`:\n\n- It needs to be an async function itself so we can await it.\n- Its first parameter should be a future to run. We can make it generic to allow\n  it to work with any future.\n- Its second parameter will be the maximum time to wait. If we use a `Duration`,\n  that will make it easy to pass along to `trpl::sleep`.\n- It should return a `Result`. If the future completes successfully, the\n  `Result` will be `Ok` with the value produced by the future. If the timeout\n  elapses first, the `Result` will be `Err` with the duration that the timeout\n  waited for.\n\nListing 17-19 shows this declaration.\n\n<!-- This is not tested because it intentionally does not compile. -->\n\n<Listing number=\"17-19\" caption=\"Defining the signature of `timeout`\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-19/src/main.rs:declaration}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThat satisfies our goals for the types. Now let\u2019s think about the _behavior_ we\nneed: we want to race the future passed in against the duration. We can use\n`trpl::sleep` to make a timer future from the duration, and use `trpl::select`\nto run that timer with the future the caller passes in.\n\nIn Listing 17-20, we implement `timeout` by matching on the result of awaiting\n`trpl::select`.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-20\" caption=\"Defining `timeout` with `select` and `sleep`\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-20/src/main.rs:implementation}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe implementation of `trpl::select` is not fair: it always polls arguments in\nthe order in which they are passed (other `select` implementations will\nrandomly choose which argument to poll first). Thus, we pass `future_to_try` to\n`select` first so it gets a chance to complete even if `max_time` is a very\nshort duration. If `future_to_try` finishes first, `select` will return `Left`\nwith the output from `future_to_try`. If `timer` finishes first, `select` will\nreturn `Right` with the timer\u2019s output of `()`.\n\nIf the `future_to_try` succeeds and we get a `Left(output)`, we return\n`Ok(output)`. If the sleep timer elapses instead and we get a `Right(())`, we\nignore the `()` with `_` and return `Err(max_time)` instead.\n\nWith that, we have a working `timeout` built out of two other async helpers. If\nwe run our code, it will print the failure mode after the timeout:\n\n```text\nFailed after 2 seconds\n```\n\nBecause futures compose with other futures, you can build really powerful tools\nusing smaller async building blocks. For example, you can use this same\napproach to combine timeouts with retries, and in turn use those with\noperations such as network calls (such as those in Listing 17-5).\n\nIn practice, you\u2019ll usually work directly with `async` and `await`, and\nsecondarily with functions such as `select` and macros such as the `join!`\nmacro to control how the outermost futures are executed.\n\nWe\u2019ve now seen a number of ways to work with multiple futures at the same time.\nUp next, we\u2019ll look at how we can work with multiple futures in a sequence over\ntime with _streams_.\n\n[async-program]: ch17-01-futures-and-syntax.html#our-first-async-program",

The async\n`recv` method produces a sequence of items over time. This is an instance of a\nmuch more general pattern known as a _stream_. Many concepts are naturally\nrepresented as streams: items becoming available in a queue, chunks of data\nbeing pulled incrementally from the filesystem when the full data set is too\nlarge for the computer\u2019s memory, or data arriving over the network over time.\nBecause streams are futures, we can use them with any other kind of future and\ncombine them in interesting ways. For example, we can batch up events to avoid\ntriggering too many network calls, set timeouts on sequences of long-running\noperations, or throttle user interface events to avoid doing needless work.\n\nWe saw a sequence of items back in Chapter 13, when we looked at the Iterator\ntrait in [\u201cThe Iterator Trait and the `next` Method\u201d][iterator-trait]<!--\nignore --> section, but there are two differences between iterators and the\nasync channel receiver. The first difference is time: iterators are\nsynchronous, while the channel receiver is asynchronous. The second difference\nis the API. When working directly with `Iterator`, we call its synchronous\n`next` method. With the `trpl::Receiver` stream in particular, we called an\nasynchronous `recv` method instead. Otherwise, these APIs feel very similar,\nand that similarity isn\u2019t a coincidence. A stream is like an asynchronous form\nof iteration. Whereas the `trpl::Receiver` specifically waits to receive\nmessages, though, the general-purpose stream API is much broader: it provides\nthe next item the way `Iterator` does, but asynchronously.\n\nThe similarity between iterators and streams in Rust means we can actually\ncreate a stream from any iterator. As with an iterator, we can work with a\nstream by calling its `next` method and then awaiting the output, as in Listing\n17-21, which won\u2019t compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-21\" caption=\"Creating a stream from an iterator and printing its values\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-21/src/main.rs:stream}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe start with an array of numbers, which we convert to an iterator and then\ncall `map` on to double all the values. Then we convert the iterator into a\nstream using the `trpl::stream_from_iter` function. Next, we loop over the\nitems in the stream as they arrive with the `while let` loop.\n\nUnfortunately, when we try to run the code, it doesn\u2019t compile but instead\nreports that there\u2019s no `next` method available:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-21\ncargo build\ncopy only the error output\n-->\n\n```text\nerror[E0599]: no method named `next` found for struct `tokio_stream::iter::Iter` in the current scope\n  --> src/main.rs:10:40\n   |\n10 |         while let Some(value) = stream.next().await {\n   |                                        ^^^^\n   |\n   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope\nhelp: the following traits which provide `next` are implemented but not in scope; perhaps you want to import one of them\n   |\n1  + use crate::trpl::StreamExt;\n   |\n1  + use futures_util::stream::stream::StreamExt;\n   |\n1  + use std::iter::Iterator;\n   |\n1  + use std::str::pattern::Searcher;\n   |\nhelp: there is a method `try_next` with a similar name\n   |\n10 |         while let Some(value) = stream.try_next().await {\n   |                                        ~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nAs this output explains, the reason for the compiler error is that we need the\nright trait in scope to be able to use the `next` method. Given our discussion\nso far, you might reasonably expect that trait to be `Stream`, but it\u2019s\nactually `StreamExt`. Short for _extension_, `Ext` is a common pattern in the\nRust community for extending one trait with another.\n\nThe `Stream` trait defines a low-level interface that effectively combines the\n`Iterator` and `Future` traits. `StreamExt` supplies a higher-level set of APIs\non top of `Stream`, including the `next` method as well as other utility\nmethods similar to those provided by the `Iterator` trait. `Stream` and\n`StreamExt` are not yet part of Rust\u2019s standard library, but most ecosystem\ncrates use similar definitions.\n\nThe fix to the compiler error is to add a `use` statement for\n`trpl::StreamExt`, as in Listing 17-22.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-22\" caption=\"Successfully using an iterator as the basis for a stream\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-22/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWith all those pieces put together, this code works the way we want! What\u2019s\nmore, now that we have `StreamExt` in scope, we can use all of its utility\nmethods, just as with iterators.\n\n[17-02-messages]: ch17-02-concurrency-with-async.html#message-passing\n[iterator-trait]: ch13-02-iterators.html#the-iterator-trait-and-the-next-method",

    "title": "The `Future` Trait",
    "content": "Let\u2019s start by taking a closer look at how the `Future` trait works. Here\u2019s how\nRust defines it:\n\n```rust\nuse std::pin::Pin;\nuse std::task::{Context, Poll};\n\npub trait Future {\n    type Output;\n\n    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;\n}\n```\n\nThat trait definition includes a bunch of new types and also some syntax we\nhaven\u2019t seen before, so let\u2019s walk through the definition piece by piece.\n\nFirst, `Future`\u2019s associated type `Output` says what the future resolves to.\nThis is analogous to the `Item` associated type for the `Iterator` trait.\nSecond, `Future` has the `poll` method, which takes a special `Pin` reference\nfor its `self` parameter and a mutable reference to a `Context` type, and\nreturns a `Poll<Self::Output>`. We\u2019ll talk more about `Pin` and `Context` in a\nmoment. For now, let\u2019s focus on what the method returns, the `Poll` type:\n\n```rust\npub enum Poll<T> {\n    Ready(T),\n    Pending,\n}\n```\n\nThis `Poll` type is similar to an `Option`. It has one variant that has a value,\n`Ready(T)`, and one that does not, `Pending`. `Poll` means something quite\ndifferent from `Option`, though! The `Pending` variant indicates that the future\nstill has work to do, so the caller will need to check again later. The `Ready`\nvariant indicates that the `Future` has finished its work and the `T` value is\navailable.\n\n> Note: It\u2019s rare to need to call `poll` directly, but if you do need to, keep\n> in mind that with most futures, the caller should not call `poll` again after\n> the future has returned `Ready`. Many futures will panic if polled again after\n> becoming ready. Futures that are safe to poll again will say so explicitly in\n> their documentation. This is similar to how `Iterator::next` behaves.\n\nWhen you see code that uses `await`, Rust compiles it under the hood to code\nthat calls `poll`. If you look back at Listing 17-4, where we printed out the\npage title for a single URL once it resolved, Rust compiles it into something\nkind of (although not exactly) like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nmatch page_title(url).poll() {\n    Ready(page_title) => match page_title {\n        Some(title) => println!(\"The title for {url} was {title}\"),\n        None => println!(\"{url} had no title\"),\n    }\n    Pending => {\n        // But what goes here?\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat should we do when the future is still `Pending`? We need some way to try\nagain, and again, and again, until the future is finally ready. In other words,\nwe need a loop:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet mut page_title_fut = page_title(url);\nloop {\n    match page_title_fut.poll() {\n        Ready(value) => match page_title {\n            Some(title) => println!(\"The title for {url} was {title}\"),\n            None => println!(\"{url} had no title\"),\n        }\n        Pending => {\n            // continue\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf Rust compiled it to exactly that code, though, every `await` would be\nblocking\u2014exactly the opposite of what we were going for! Instead, Rust ensures\nthat the loop can hand off control to something that can pause work on this\nfuture to work on other futures and then check this one again later. As we\u2019ve\nseen, that something is an async runtime, and this scheduling and coordination\nwork is one of its main jobs.\n\nIn the [\u201cSending Data Between Two Tasks Using Message\nPassing\u201d][message-passing]<!-- ignore --> section, we described waiting on\n`rx.recv`. The `recv` call returns a future, and awaiting the future polls it.\nWe noted that a runtime will pause the future until it\u2019s ready with either\n`Some(message)` or `None` when the channel closes. With our deeper\nunderstanding of the `Future` trait, and specifically `Future::poll`, we can\nsee how that works. The runtime knows the future isn\u2019t ready when it returns\n`Poll::Pending`. Conversely, the runtime knows the future _is_ ready and\nadvances it when `poll` returns `Poll::Ready(Some(message))` or\n`Poll::Ready(None)`.\n\nThe exact details of how a runtime does that are beyond the scope of this book,\nbut the key is to see the basic mechanics of futures: a runtime _polls_ each\nfuture it is responsible for, putting the future back to sleep when it is not\nyet ready.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

Let\u2019s change Listing\n17-13 to the code in Listing 17-23 that puts the three futures into a vector\nand calls the `trpl::join_all` function instead, which won\u2019t compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-23\" caption=\"Awaiting futures in a collection\"  file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-23/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe put each future within a `Box` to make them into _trait objects_, just as\nwe did in the \u201cReturning Errors from `run`\u201d section in Chapter 12. (We\u2019ll cover\ntrait objects in detail in Chapter 18.) Using trait objects lets us treat each\nof the anonymous futures produced by these types as the same type, because all\nof them implement the `Future` trait.\n\nThis might be surprising. After all, none of the async blocks returns anything,\nso each one produces a `Future<Output = ()>`. Remember that `Future` is a\ntrait, though, and that the compiler creates a unique enum for each async\nblock, even when they have identical output types. Just as you can\u2019t put two\ndifferent handwritten structs in a `Vec`, you can\u2019t mix compiler-generated\nenums.\n\nThen we pass the collection of futures to the `trpl::join_all` function and\nawait the result. However, this doesn\u2019t compile; here\u2019s the relevant part of\nthe error messages.\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-23\ncargo build\ncopy *only* the final `error` block from the errors\n-->\n\n```text\nerror[E0277]: `dyn Future<Output = ()>` cannot be unpinned\n  --> src/main.rs:48:33\n   |\n48 |         trpl::join_all(futures).await;\n   |                                 ^^^^^ the trait `Unpin` is not implemented for `dyn Future<Output = ()>`\n   |\n   = note: consider using the `pin!` macro\n           consider using `Box::pin` if you need to access the pinned value outside of the current scope\n   = note: required for `Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>` to implement `Future`\nnote: required by a bound in `futures_util::future::join_all::JoinAll`\n  --> file:///home/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/futures-util-0.3.30/src/future/join_all.rs:29:8\n   |\n27 | pub struct JoinAll<F>\n   |            ------- required by a bound in this struct\n28 | where\n29 |     F: Future,\n   |        ^^^^^^ required by this bound in `JoinAll`\n```\n\nThe note in this error message tells us that we should use the `pin!` macro to\n_pin_ the values, which means putting them inside the `Pin` type that\nguarantees the values won\u2019t be moved in memory. The error message says pinning\nis required because `dyn Future<Output = ()>` needs to implement the `Unpin`\ntrait and it currently does not.\n\nThe `trpl::join_all` function returns a struct called `JoinAll`. That struct is\ngeneric over a type `F`, which is constrained to implement the `Future` trait.\nDirectly awaiting a future with `await` pins the future implicitly. That\u2019s why\nwe don\u2019t need to use `pin!` everywhere we want to await futures.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re not directly awaiting a future here. Instead, we construct a new\nfuture, JoinAll, by passing a collection of futures to the `join_all` function.\nThe signature for `join_all` requires that the types of the items in the\ncollection all implement the `Future` trait, and `Box<T>` implements `Future`\nonly if the `T` it wraps is a future that implements the `Unpin` trait.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to absorb! To really understand it, let\u2019s dive a little further\ninto how the `Future` trait actually works, in particular around pinning. Look\nagain at the definition of the `Future` trait:\n\n```rust\nuse std::pin::Pin;\nuse std::task::{Context, Poll};\n\npub trait Future {\n    type Output;\n\n    // Required method\n    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;\n}\n```\n\nThe `cx` parameter and its `Context` type are the key to how a runtime actually\nknows when to check any given future while still being lazy. Again, the details\nof how that works are beyond the scope of this chapter, and you generally only\nneed to think about this when writing a custom `Future` implementation. We\u2019ll\nfocus instead on the type for `self`, as this is the first time we\u2019ve seen a\nmethod where `self` has a type annotation. A type annotation for `self` works\nlike type annotations for other function parameters but with two key\ndifferences:\n\n- It tells Rust what type `self` must be for the method to be called.\n- It can\u2019t be just any type. It\u2019s restricted to the type on which the method is\n  implemented, a reference or smart pointer to that type, or a `Pin` wrapping a\n  reference to that type.\n\nWe\u2019ll see more on this syntax in [Chapter 18][ch-18]<!-- ignore -->. For now,\nit\u2019s enough to know that if we want to poll a future to check whether it is\n`Pending` or `Ready(Output)`, we need a `Pin`-wrapped mutable reference to the\ntype.\n\n`Pin` is a wrapper for pointer-like types such as `&`, `&mut`, `Box`, and `Rc`.\n(Technically, `Pin` works with types that implement the `Deref` or `DerefMut`\ntraits, but this is effectively equivalent to working only with references and\nsmart pointers.) `Pin` is not a pointer itself and doesn\u2019t have any behavior of\nits own like `Rc` and `Arc` do with reference counting; it\u2019s purely a tool the\ncompiler can use to enforce constraints on pointer usage.\n\nRecalling that `await` is implemented in terms of calls to `poll` starts to\nexplain the error message we saw earlier, but that was in terms of `Unpin`, not\n`Pin`. So how exactly does `Pin` relate to `Unpin`, and why does `Future` need\n`self` to be in a `Pin` type to call `poll`?\n\nRemember from earlier in this chapter that a series of await points in a future\nget compiled into a state machine, and the compiler makes sure that state\nmachine follows all of Rust\u2019s normal rules around safety, including borrowing\nand ownership. To make that work, Rust looks at what data is needed between one\nawait point and either the next await point or the end of the async block. It\nthen creates a corresponding variant in the compiled state machine. Each\nvariant gets the access it needs to the data that will be used in that section\nof the source code, whether by taking ownership of that data or by getting a\nmutable or immutable reference to it.\n\nSo far, so good: if we get anything wrong about the ownership or references in\na given async block, the borrow checker will tell us. When we want to move\naround the future that corresponds to that block\u2014like moving it into a `Vec` to\npass to `join_all`\u2014things get trickier.\n\nWhen we move a future\u2014whether by pushing it into a data structure to use as an\niterator with `join_all` or by returning it from a function\u2014that actually means\nmoving the state machine Rust creates for us. And unlike most other types in\nRust, the futures Rust creates for async blocks can end up with references to\nthemselves in the fields of any given variant, as shown in the simplified illustration in Figure 17-4.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"A single-column, three-row table representing a future, fut1, which has data values 0 and 1 in the first two rows and an arrow pointing from the third row back to the second row, representing an internal reference within the future.\" src=\"img/trpl17-04.svg\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-4: A self-referential data type</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nBy default, though, any object that has a reference to itself is unsafe to move,\nbecause references always point to the actual memory address of whatever they\nrefer to (see Figure 17-5). If you move the data structure itself, those\ninternal references will be left pointing to the old location. However, that\nmemory location is now invalid. For one thing, its value will not be updated\nwhen you make changes to the data structure. For another\u2014more important\u2014thing,\nthe computer is now free to reuse that memory for other purposes! You could end\nup reading completely unrelated data later.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"Two tables, depicting two futures, fut1 and fut2, each of which has one column and three rows, representing the result of having moved a future out of fut1 into fut2. The first, fut1, is grayed out, with a question mark in each index, representing unknown memory. The second, fut2, has 0 and 1 in the first and second rows and an arrow pointing from its third row back to the second row of fut1, representing a pointer that is referencing the old location in memory of the future before it was moved.\" src=\"img/trpl17-05.svg\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-5: The unsafe result of moving a self-referential data type</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTheoretically, the Rust compiler could try to update every reference to an\nobject whenever it gets moved, but that could add a lot of performance overhead,\nespecially if a whole web of references needs updating. If we could instead make\nsure the data structure in question _doesn\u2019t move in memory_, we wouldn\u2019t have\nto update any references. This is exactly what Rust\u2019s borrow checker is for:\nin safe code, it prevents you from moving any item with an active reference to\nit.\n\n`Pin` builds on that to give us the exact guarantee we need. When we _pin_ a\nvalue by wrapping a pointer to that value in `Pin`, it can no longer move. Thus,\nif you have `Pin<Box<SomeType>>`, you actually pin the `SomeType` value, _not_\nthe `Box` pointer. Figure 17-6 illustrates this process.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"Three boxes laid out side by side. The first is labeled \u201cPin\u201d, the second \u201cb1\u201d, and the third \u201cpinned\u201d. Within \u201cpinned\u201d is a table labeled \u201cfut\u201d, with a single column; it represents a future with cells for each part of the data structure. Its first cell has the value \u201c0\u201d, its second cell has an arrow coming out of it and pointing to the fourth and final cell, which has the value \u201c1\u201d in it, and the third cell has dashed lines and an ellipsis to indicate there may be other parts to the data structure. All together, the \u201cfut\u201d table represents a future which is self-referential. An arrow leaves the box labeled \u201cPin\u201d, goes through the box labeled \u201cb1\u201d and terminates inside the \u201cpinned\u201d box at the \u201cfut\u201d table.\" src=\"img/trpl17-06.svg\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-6: Pinning a `Box` that points to a self-referential future type</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn fact, the `Box` pointer can still move around freely. Remember: we care about\nmaking sure the data ultimately being referenced stays in place. If a pointer\nmoves around, _but the data it points to_ is in the same place, as in Figure\n17-7, there\u2019s no potential problem. (As an independent exercise, look at the docs\nfor the types as well as the `std::pin` module and try to work out how you\u2019d do\nthis with a `Pin` wrapping a `Box`.) The key is that the self-referential type\nitself cannot move, because it is still pinned.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"Four boxes laid out in three rough columns, identical to the previous diagram with a change to the second column. Now there are two boxes in the second column, labeled \u201cb1\u201d and \u201cb2\u201d, \u201cb1\u201d is grayed out, and the arrow from \u201cPin\u201d goes through \u201cb2\u201d instead of \u201cb1\u201d, indicating that the pointer has moved from \u201cb1\u201d to \u201cb2\u201d, but the data in \u201cpinned\u201d has not moved.\" src=\"img/trpl17-07.svg\" class=\"center\" />\n\n<figcaption>Figure 17-7: Moving a `Box` which points to a self-referential future type</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nHowever, most types are perfectly safe to move around, even if they happen to be\nbehind a `Pin` pointer. We only need to think about pinning when items have\ninternal references. Primitive values such as numbers and Booleans are safe\nbecause they obviously don\u2019t have any internal references.\nNeither do most types you normally work with in Rust. You can move around\na `Vec`, for example, without worrying. Given what we have seen so far, if\nyou have a `Pin<Vec<String>>`, you\u2019d have to do everything via the safe but\nrestrictive APIs provided by `Pin`, even though a `Vec<String>` is always safe\nto move if there are no other references to it. We need a way to tell the\ncompiler that it\u2019s fine to move items around in cases like this\u2014and that\u2019s\nwhere `Unpin` comes into play.\n\n`Unpin` is a marker trait, similar to the `Send` and `Sync` traits we saw in\nChapter 16, and thus has no functionality of its own. Marker traits exist only\nto tell the compiler it\u2019s safe to use the type implementing a given trait in a\nparticular context. `Unpin` informs the compiler that a given type does _not_\nneed to uphold any guarantees about whether the value in question can be safely\nmoved.\n\n<!--\n  The inline `<code>` in the next block is to allow the inline `<em>` inside it,\n  matching what NoStarch does style-wise, and emphasizing within the text here\n  that it is something distinct from a normal type.\n-->\n\nJust as with `Send` and `Sync`, the compiler implements `Unpin` automatically\nfor all types where it can prove it is safe. A special case, again similar to\n`Send` and `Sync`, is where `Unpin` is _not_ implemented for a type. The\nnotation for this is <code>impl !Unpin for <em>SomeType</em></code>, where\n<code><em>SomeType</em></code> is the name of a type that _does_ need to uphold\nthose guarantees to be safe whenever a pointer to that type is used in a `Pin`.\n\nIn other words, there are two things to keep in mind about the relationship\nbetween `Pin` and `Unpin`. First, `Unpin` is the \u201cnormal\u201d case, and `!Unpin` is\nthe special case. Second, whether a type implements `Unpin` or `!Unpin` _only_\nmatters when you\u2019re using a pinned pointer to that type like <code>Pin<&mut\n<em>SomeType</em>></code>.\n\nTo make that concrete, think about a `String`: it has a length and the Unicode\ncharacters that make it up. We can wrap a `String` in `Pin`, as seen in Figure\n17-8. However, `String` automatically implements `Unpin`, as do most other types\nin Rust.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"A box labeled \u201cPin\u201d on the left with an arrow going from it to a box labeled \u201cString\u201d on the right. The \u201cString\u201d box contains the data 5usize, representing the length of the string, and the letters \u201ch\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201cl\u201d, \u201cl\u201d, and \u201co\u201d representing the characters of the string \u201chello\u201d stored in this String instance.

This doesn\u2019t violate the `Pin` contract,\nbecause `String` has no internal references that make it unsafe to move around.\nThat is precisely why it implements `Unpin` rather than `!Unpin`.\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"The same \u201chello\u201d string data from the previous example, now labeled \u201cs1\u201d and grayed out.

We originally tried to move the futures produced by\nasync blocks into a `Vec<Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>>`, but as we\u2019ve seen,\nthose futures may have internal references, so they don\u2019t automatically\nimplement `Unpin`. Once we pin them, we can pass the resulting `Pin` type into\nthe `Vec`, confident that the underlying data in the futures will _not_ be\nmoved. Listing 17-24 shows how to fix the code by calling the `pin!` macro\nwhere each of the three futures are defined and adjusting the trait object type.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-24\" caption=\"Pinning the futures to enable moving them into the vector\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-24/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis example now compiles and runs, and we could add or remove futures from the\nvector at runtime and join them all.\n\n`Pin` and `Unpin` are mostly important for building lower-level libraries, or\nwhen you\u2019re building a runtime itself, rather than for day-to-day Rust code.\nWhen you see these traits in error messages, though, now you\u2019ll have a better\nidea of how to fix your code!\n\n> Note: This combination of `Pin` and `Unpin` makes it possible to safely\n> implement a whole class of complex types in Rust that would otherwise prove\n> challenging because they\u2019re self-referential.

    "title": "The `Stream` Trait",
    "content": "Now that you have a deeper grasp on the `Future`, `Pin`, and `Unpin` traits, we\ncan turn our attention to the `Stream` trait. As you learned earlier in the\nchapter, streams are similar to asynchronous iterators. Unlike `Iterator` and\n`Future`, however, `Stream` has no definition in the standard library as of\nthis writing, but there _is_ a very common definition from the `futures` crate\nused throughout the ecosystem.\n\nLet\u2019s review the definitions of the `Iterator` and `Future` traits before\nlooking at how a `Stream` trait might merge them together. From `Iterator`, we\nhave the idea of a sequence: its `next` method provides an\n`Option<Self::Item>`. From `Future`, we have the idea of readiness over time:\nits `poll` method provides a `Poll<Self::Output>`. To represent a sequence of\nitems that become ready over time, we define a `Stream` trait that puts those\nfeatures together:\n\n```rust\nuse std::pin::Pin;\nuse std::task::{Context, Poll};\n\ntrait Stream {\n    type Item;\n\n    fn poll_next(\n        self: Pin<&mut Self>,\n        cx: &mut Context<'_>\n    ) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>>;\n}\n```\n\nThe `Stream` trait defines an associated type called `Item` for the type of the\nitems produced by the stream. This is similar to `Iterator`, where there may be\nzero to many items, and unlike `Future`, where there is always a single\n`Output`, even if it\u2019s the unit type `()`.\n\n`Stream` also defines a method to get those items. We call it `poll_next`, to\nmake it clear that it polls in the same way `Future::poll` does and produces a\nsequence of items in the same way `Iterator::next` does. Its return type\ncombines `Poll` with `Option`. The outer type is `Poll`, because it has to be\nchecked for readiness, just as a future does. The inner type is `Option`,\nbecause it needs to signal whether there are more messages, just as an iterator\ndoes.\n\nSomething very similar to this definition will likely end up as part of Rust\u2019s\nstandard library. In the meantime, it\u2019s part of the toolkit of most runtimes,\nso you can rely on it, and everything we cover next should generally apply!\n\nIn the examples we saw in the [\u201cStreams: Futures in Sequence\u201d][streams]<!--\nignore --> section, though, we didn\u2019t use `poll_next` _or_ `Stream`, but\ninstead used `next` and `StreamExt`. We _could_ work directly in terms of the\n`poll_next` API by hand-writing our own `Stream` state machines, of course,\njust as we _could_ work with futures directly via their `poll` method. Using\n`await` is much nicer, though, and the `StreamExt` trait supplies the `next`\nmethod so we can do just that:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/no-listing-stream-ext/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n<!--\nTODO: update this if/when tokio/etc. update their MSRV and switch to using async functions\nin traits, since the lack thereof is the reason they do not yet have this.\n-->\n\n> Note: The actual definition we used earlier in the chapter looks slightly\n> different than this, because it supports versions of Rust that did not yet\n> support using async functions in traits. As a result, it looks like this:\n>\n> ```rust,ignore\n> fn next(&mut self) -> Next<'_, Self> where Self: Unpin;\n> ```\n>\n> That `Next` type is a `struct` that implements `Future` and allows us to name\n> the lifetime of the reference to `self` with `Next<'_, Self>`, so that `await`\n> can work with this method.\n\nThe `StreamExt` trait is also the home of all the interesting methods available\nto use with streams. `StreamExt` is automatically implemented for every type\nthat implements `Stream`, but these traits are defined separately to enable the\ncommunity to iterate on convenience APIs without affecting the foundational\ntrait.\n\nIn the version of `StreamExt` used in the `trpl` crate, the trait not only\ndefines the `next` method but also supplies a default implementation of `next`\nthat correctly handles the details of calling `Stream::poll_next`. This means\nthat even when you need to write your own streaming data type, you _only_ have\nto implement `Stream`, and then anyone who uses your data type can use\n`StreamExt` and its methods with it automatically.\n\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019re going to cover for the lower-level details on these traits. To\nwrap up, let\u2019s consider how futures (including streams), tasks, and threads all\nfit together!\n\n[message-passing]: ch17-02-concurrency-with-async.md#sending-data-between-two-tasks-using-message-passing\n[ch-18]: ch18-00-oop.html\n[async-book]: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/\n[under-the-hood]: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/01_chapter.html\n[pinning]: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/04_pinning/01_chapter.html\n[first-async]: ch17-01-futures-and-syntax.html#our-first-async-program\n[any-number-futures]: ch17-03-more-futures.html#working-with-any-number-of-futures\n[streams]: ch17-04-streams.html",

    "content": "## Putting It All Together: Futures, Tasks, and Threads\n\nAs we saw in [Chapter 16][ch16]<!-- ignore -->, threads provide one approach to\nconcurrency. We\u2019ve seen another approach in this chapter: using async with\nfutures and streams. If you\u2019re wondering when to choose one method over the other,\nthe answer is: it depends! And in many cases, the choice isn\u2019t threads _or_\nasync but rather threads _and_ async.\n\nMany operating systems have supplied threading-based concurrency models for\ndecades now, and many programming languages support them as a result. However,\nthese models are not without their tradeoffs. On many operating systems, they\nuse a fair bit of memory for each thread. Threads are also only an option when\nyour operating system and hardware support them. Unlike mainstream desktop and\nmobile computers, some embedded systems don\u2019t have an OS at all, so they also\ndon\u2019t have threads.\n\nThe async model provides a different\u2014and ultimately complementary\u2014set of\ntradeoffs. In the async model, concurrent operations don\u2019t require their own\nthreads. Instead, they can run on tasks, as when we used `trpl::spawn_task` to\nkick off work from a synchronous function in the streams section. A task is\nsimilar to a thread, but instead of being managed by the operating system, it\u2019s\nmanaged by library-level code: the runtime.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the APIs for spawning threads and spawning tasks are so\nsimilar. Threads act as a boundary for sets of synchronous operations;\nconcurrency is possible _between_ threads. Tasks act as a boundary for sets of\n_asynchronous_ operations; concurrency is possible both _between_ and _within_\ntasks, because a task can switch between futures in its body. Finally, futures\nare Rust\u2019s most granular unit of concurrency, and each future may represent a\ntree of other futures. The runtime\u2014specifically, its executor\u2014manages tasks,\nand tasks manage futures. In that regard, tasks are similar to lightweight,\nruntime-managed threads with added capabilities that come from being managed by\na runtime instead of by the operating system.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that async tasks are always better than threads (or vice\nversa). Concurrency with threads is in some ways a simpler programming model\nthan concurrency with `async`. That can be a strength or a weakness. Threads are\nsomewhat \u201cfire and forget\u201d; they have no native equivalent to a future, so they\nsimply run to completion without being interrupted except by the operating\nsystem itself.\n\nAnd it turns out that threads and tasks often work\nvery well together, because tasks can (at least in some runtimes) be moved\naround between threads. In fact, under the hood, the runtime we\u2019ve been\nusing\u2014including the `spawn_blocking` and `spawn_task` functions\u2014is multithreaded\nby default! Many runtimes use an approach called _work stealing_ to\ntransparently move tasks around between threads, based on how the threads are\ncurrently being utilized, to improve the system\u2019s overall performance. That\napproach actually requires threads _and_ tasks, and therefore futures.\n\nWhen thinking about which method to use when, consider these rules of thumb:\n\n- If the work is _very parallelizable_ (that is, CPU-bound), such as processing\n  a bunch of data where each part can be processed separately, threads are a\n  better choice.\n- If the work is _very concurrent_ (that is, I/O-bound), such as handling\n  messages from a bunch of different sources that may come in at different\n  intervals or different rates, async is a better choice.\n\nAnd if you need both parallelism and concurrency, you don\u2019t have to choose\nbetween threads and async. You can use them together freely, letting each\nplay the part it\u2019s best at. For example, Listing 17-25 shows a fairly common\nexample of this kind of mix in real-world Rust code.\n\n<Listing number=\"17-25\" caption=\"Sending messages with blocking code in a thread and awaiting the messages in an async block\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-25/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe begin by creating an async channel, then spawning a thread that takes\nownership of the sender side of the channel using the `move` keyword. Within\nthe thread, we send the numbers 1 through 10, sleeping for a second between\neach. Finally, we run a future created with an async block passed to\n`trpl::block_on` just as we have throughout the chapter. In that future, we\nawait those messages, just as in the other message-passing examples we have\nseen.\n\nTo return to the scenario we opened the chapter with, imagine running a set of\nvideo encoding tasks using a dedicated thread (because video encoding is\ncompute-bound) but notifying the UI that those operations are done with an\nasync channel. There are countless examples of these kinds of combinations in\nreal-world use cases.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis isn\u2019t the last you\u2019ll see of concurrency in this book. The project in\n[Chapter 21][ch21]<!-- ignore --> will apply these concepts in a more realistic\nsituation than the simpler examples discussed here and compare problem-solving\nwith threading versus tasks and futures more directly.\n\nNo matter which of these approaches you choose, Rust gives you the tools you\nneed to write safe, fast, concurrent code\u2014whether for a high-throughput web\nserver or an embedded operating system.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll talk about idiomatic ways to model problems and structure solutions\nas your Rust programs get bigger. In addition, we\u2019ll discuss how Rust\u2019s idioms\nrelate to those you might be familiar with from object-oriented programming.\n\n[ch16]: http://localhost:3000/ch16-00-concurrency.html\n[combining-futures]: ch17-03-more-futures.html#building-our-own-async-abstractions\n[streams]: ch17-04-streams.html#composing-streams\n[ch21]: ch21-00-final-project-a-web-server.html",

Objects as a\nprogrammatic concept were introduced in the programming language Simula in the\n1960s. Those objects influenced Alan Kay\u2019s programming architecture in which\nobjects pass messages to each other. To describe this architecture, he coined\nthe term _object-oriented programming_ in 1967. Many competing definitions\ndescribe what OOP is, and by some of these definitions Rust is object oriented\nbut by others it is not. In this chapter, we\u2019ll explore certain characteristics\nthat are commonly considered object oriented and how those characteristics\ntranslate to idiomatic Rust. We\u2019ll then show you how to implement an\nobject-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the trade-offs of doing so\nversus implementing a solution using some of Rust\u2019s strengths instead.",

    "title": "Encapsulation That Hides Implementation Details",
    "content": "Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of _encapsulation_,\nwhich means that the implementation details of an object aren\u2019t accessible to\ncode using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is\nthrough its public API; code using the object shouldn\u2019t be able to reach into\nthe object\u2019s internals and change data or behavior directly. This enables the\nprogrammer to change and refactor an object\u2019s internals without needing to\nchange the code that uses the object.\n\nWe discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: We can use the `pub`\nkeyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in our code\nshould be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we\ncan define a struct `AveragedCollection` that has a field containing a vector\nof `i32` values. The struct can also have a field that contains the average of\nthe values in the vector, meaning the average doesn\u2019t have to be computed on\ndemand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, `AveragedCollection` will\ncache the calculated average for us. Listing 18-1 has the definition of the\n`AveragedCollection` struct.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-1\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An `AveragedCollection` struct that maintains a list of integers and the average of the items in the collection\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-01/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe struct is marked `pub` so that other code can use it, but the fields within\nthe struct remain private. This is important in this case because we want to\nensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the average is\nalso updated. We do this by implementing `add`, `remove`, and `average` methods\non the struct, as shown in Listing 18-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-2\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementations of the public methods `add`, `remove`, and `average` on `AveragedCollection`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-02/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe public methods `add`, `remove`, and `average` are the only ways to access\nor modify data in an instance of `AveragedCollection`. When an item is added to\n`list` using the `add` method or removed using the `remove` method, the\nimplementations of each call the private `update_average` method that handles\nupdating the `average` field as well.\n\nWe leave the `list` and `average` fields private so that there is no way for\nexternal code to add or remove items to or from the `list` field directly;\notherwise, the `average` field might become out of sync when the `list`\nchanges. The `average` method returns the value in the `average` field,\nallowing external code to read the `average` but not modify it.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve encapsulated the implementation details of the struct\n`AveragedCollection`, we can easily change aspects, such as the data structure,\nin the future. For instance, we could use a `HashSet<i32>` instead of a\n`Vec<i32>` for the `list` field. As long as the signatures of the `add`,\n`remove`, and `average` public methods stayed the same, code using\n`AveragedCollection` wouldn\u2019t need to change. If we made `list` public instead,\nthis wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the case: `HashSet<i32>` and `Vec<i32>` have\ndifferent methods for adding and removing items, so the external code would\nlikely have to change if it were modifying `list` directly.\n\nIf encapsulation is a required aspect for a language to be considered object\noriented, then Rust meets that requirement. The option to use `pub` or not for\ndifferent parts of code enables encapsulation of implementation details.",

    "title": "Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing",
    "content": "_Inheritance_ is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from\nanother object\u2019s definition, thus gaining the parent object\u2019s data and behavior\nwithout you having to define them again.\n\nIf a language must have inheritance to be object oriented, then Rust is not\nsuch a language. There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent\nstruct\u2019s fields and method implementations without using a macro.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re used to having inheritance in your programming toolbox, you\ncan use other solutions in Rust, depending on your reason for reaching for\ninheritance in the first place.\n\nYou would choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code:\nYou can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables you\nto reuse that implementation for a different type. You can do this in a limited\nway in Rust code using default trait method implementations, which you saw in\nListing 10-14 when we added a default implementation of the `summarize` method\non the `Summary` trait. Any type implementing the `Summary` trait would have\nthe `summarize` method available on it without any further code. This is\nsimilar to a parent class having an implementation of a method and an\ninheriting child class also having the implementation of the method. We can\nalso override the default implementation of the `summarize` method when we\nimplement the `Summary` trait, which is similar to a child class overriding the\nimplementation of a method inherited from a parent class.\n\nThe other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to enable a\nchild type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also\ncalled _polymorphism_, which means that you can substitute multiple objects for\neach other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.\n\n> ### Polymorphism\n>\n> To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it\u2019s\n> actually a more general concept that refers to code that can work with data of\n> multiple types. For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses.\n>\n> Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and\n> trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is\n> sometimes called _bounded parametric polymorphism_.\n\nRust has chosen a different set of trade-offs by not offering inheritance.\nInheritance is often at risk of sharing more code than necessary. Subclasses\nshouldn\u2019t always share all characteristics of their parent class but will do so\nwith inheritance. This can make a program\u2019s design less flexible. It also\nintroduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don\u2019t make\nsense or that cause errors because the methods don\u2019t apply to the subclass. In\naddition, some languages will only allow _single inheritance_ (meaning a\nsubclass can only inherit from one class), further restricting the flexibility\nof a program\u2019s design.\n\nFor these reasons, Rust takes the different approach of using trait objects\ninstead of inheritance to achieve polymorphism at runtime. Let\u2019s look at how\ntrait objects work.",

We created a workaround in Listing 8-9 where\nwe defined a `SpreadsheetCell` enum that had variants to hold integers, floats,\nand text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and\nstill have a vector that represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good\nsolution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of types that we know\nwhen our code is compiled.\n\nHowever, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the set of\ntypes that are valid in a particular situation. To show how we might achieve\nthis, we\u2019ll create an example graphical user interface (GUI) tool that iterates\nthrough a list of items, calling a `draw` method on each one to draw it to the\nscreen\u2014a common technique for GUI tools. We\u2019ll create a library crate called\n`gui` that contains the structure of a GUI library. This crate might include\nsome types for people to use, such as `Button` or `TextField`. In addition,\n`gui` users will want to create their own types that can be drawn: For\ninstance, one programmer might add an `Image`, and another might add a\n`SelectBox`.\n\nAt the time of writing the library, we can\u2019t know and define all the types\nother programmers might want to create. But we do know that `gui` needs to keep\ntrack of many values of different types, and it needs to call a `draw` method\non each of these differently typed values. It doesn\u2019t need to know exactly what\nwill happen when we call the `draw` method, just that the value will have that\nmethod available for us to call.\n\nTo do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named\n`Component` that has a method named `draw` on it. The other classes, such as\n`Button`, `Image`, and `SelectBox`, would inherit from `Component` and thus\ninherit the `draw` method. They could each override the `draw` method to define\ntheir custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if\nthey were `Component` instances and call `draw` on them. But because Rust\ndoesn\u2019t have inheritance, we need another way to structure the `gui` library to\nallow users to create new types compatible with the library.",

    "content": "To implement the behavior that we want `gui` to have, we\u2019ll define a trait\nnamed `Draw` that will have one method named `draw`. Then, we can define a\nvector that takes a trait object. A _trait object_ points to both an instance\nof a type implementing our specified trait and a table used to look up trait\nmethods on that type at runtime. We create a trait object by specifying some\nsort of pointer, such as a reference or a `Box<T>` smart pointer, then the\n`dyn` keyword, and then specifying the relevant trait. (We\u2019ll talk about the\nreason trait objects must use a pointer in [\u201cDynamically Sized Types and the\n`Sized` Trait\u201d][dynamically-sized]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 20.) We can use\ntrait objects in place of a generic or concrete type. Wherever we use a trait\nobject, Rust\u2019s type system will ensure at compile time that any value used in\nthat context will implement the trait object\u2019s trait. Consequently, we don\u2019t\nneed to know all the possible types at compile time.\n\nWe\u2019ve mentioned that, in Rust, we refrain from calling structs and enums\n\u201cobjects\u201d to distinguish them from other languages\u2019 objects. In a struct or\nenum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in `impl` blocks are\nseparated, whereas in other languages, the data and behavior combined into one\nconcept is often labeled an object. Trait objects differ from objects in other\nlanguages in that we can\u2019t add data to a trait object. Trait objects aren\u2019t as\ngenerally useful as objects in other languages: Their specific purpose is to\nallow abstraction across common behavior.\n\nListing 18-3 shows how to define a trait named `Draw` with one method named\n`draw`.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-3\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Definition of the `Draw` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-03/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis syntax should look familiar from our discussions on how to define traits\nin Chapter 10. Next comes some new syntax: Listing 18-4 defines a struct named\n`Screen` that holds a vector named `components`. This vector is of type\n`Box<dyn Draw>`, which is a trait object; it\u2019s a stand-in for any type inside a\n`Box` that implements the `Draw` trait.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-4\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Definition of the `Screen` struct with a `components` field holding a vector of trait objects that implement the `Draw` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-04/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOn the `Screen` struct, we\u2019ll define a method named `run` that will call the\n`draw` method on each of its `components`, as shown in Listing 18-5.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-5\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `run` method on `Screen` that calls the `draw` method on each component\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-05/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis works differently from defining a struct that uses a generic type\nparameter with trait bounds. A generic type parameter can be substituted with\nonly one concrete type at a time, whereas trait objects allow for multiple\nconcrete types to fill in for the trait object at runtime. For example, we\ncould have defined the `Screen` struct using a generic type and a trait bound,\nas in Listing 18-6.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-6\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An alternate implementation of the `Screen` struct and its `run` method using generics and trait bounds\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-06/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis restricts us to a `Screen` instance that has a list of components all of\ntype `Button` or all of type `TextField`. If you\u2019ll only ever have homogeneous\ncollections, using generics and trait bounds is preferable because the\ndefinitions will be monomorphized at compile time to use the concrete types.\n\nOn the other hand, with the method using trait objects, one `Screen` instance\ncan hold a `Vec<T>` that contains a `Box<Button>` as well as a\n`Box<TextField>`. Let\u2019s look at how this works, and then we\u2019ll talk about the\nruntime performance implications.",

Again, actually implementing a GUI library is beyond the scope\nof this book, so the `draw` method won\u2019t have any useful implementation in its\nbody. To imagine what the implementation might look like, a `Button` struct\nmight have fields for `width`, `height`, and `label`, as shown in Listing 18-7.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-7\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `Button` struct that implements the `Draw` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-07/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `width`, `height`, and `label` fields on `Button` will differ from the\nfields on other components; for example, a `TextField` type might have those\nsame fields plus a `placeholder` field. Each of the types we want to draw on\nthe screen will implement the `Draw` trait but will use different code in the\n`draw` method to define how to draw that particular type, as `Button` has here\n(without the actual GUI code, as mentioned). The `Button` type, for instance,\nmight have an additional `impl` block containing methods related to what\nhappens when a user clicks the button. These kinds of methods won\u2019t apply to\ntypes like `TextField`.\n\nIf someone using our library decides to implement a `SelectBox` struct that has\n`width`, `height`, and `options` fields, they would implement the `Draw` trait\non the `SelectBox` type as well, as shown in Listing 18-8.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Another crate using `gui` and implementing the `Draw` trait on a `SelectBox` struct\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOur library\u2019s user can now write their `main` function to create a `Screen`\ninstance. To the `Screen` instance, they can add a `SelectBox` and a `Button`\nby putting each in a `Box<T>` to become a trait object. They can then call the\n`run` method on the `Screen` instance, which will call `draw` on each of the\ncomponents. Listing 18-9 shows this implementation.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-9\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using trait objects to store values of different types that implement the same trait\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-09/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we wrote the library, we didn\u2019t know that someone might add the\n`SelectBox` type, but our `Screen` implementation was able to operate on the\nnew type and draw it because `SelectBox` implements the `Draw` trait, which\nmeans it implements the `draw` method.\n\nThis concept\u2014of being concerned only with the messages a value responds to\nrather than the value\u2019s concrete type\u2014is similar to the concept of _duck\ntyping_ in dynamically typed languages: If it walks like a duck and quacks like\na duck, then it must be a duck! In the implementation of `run` on `Screen` in\nListing 18-5, `run` doesn\u2019t need to know what the concrete type of each\ncomponent is. It doesn\u2019t check whether a component is an instance of a `Button`\nor a `SelectBox`, it just calls the `draw` method on the component. By\nspecifying `Box<dyn Draw>` as the type of the values in the `components`\nvector, we\u2019ve defined `Screen` to need values that we can call the `draw`\nmethod on.\n\nThe advantage of using trait objects and Rust\u2019s type system to write code\nsimilar to code using duck typing is that we never have to check whether a\nvalue implements a particular method at runtime or worry about getting errors\nif a value doesn\u2019t implement a method but we call it anyway. Rust won\u2019t compile\nour code if the values don\u2019t implement the traits that the trait objects need.\n\nFor example, Listing 18-10 shows what happens if we try to create a `Screen`\nwith a `String` as a component.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to use a type that doesn\u2019t implement the trait object\u2019s trait\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-10/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ll get this error because `String` doesn\u2019t implement the `Draw` trait:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-10/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis error lets us know that either we\u2019re passing something to `Screen` that we\ndidn\u2019t mean to pass and so should pass a different type, or we should implement\n`Draw` on `String` so that `Screen` is able to call `draw` on it.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

The crux of the\npattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally. The\nstates are represented by a set of _state objects_, and the value\u2019s behavior\nchanges based on its state. We\u2019re going to work through an example of a blog\npost struct that has a field to hold its state, which will be a state object\nfrom the set \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201creview,\u201d or \u201cpublished.\u201d\n\nThe state objects share functionality: In Rust, of course, we use structs and\ntraits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible\nfor its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another\nstate. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the different\nbehavior of the states or when to transition between states.\n\nThe advantage of using the state pattern is that, when the business\nrequirements of the program change, we won\u2019t need to change the code of the\nvalue holding the state or the code that uses the value. We\u2019ll only need to\nupdate the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps\nadd more state objects.\n\nFirst, we\u2019re going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional\nobject-oriented way. Then, we\u2019ll use an approach that\u2019s a bit more natural in\nRust. Let\u2019s dig in to incrementally implement a blog post workflow using the\nstate pattern.\n\nThe final functionality will look like this:\n\n1. A blog post starts as an empty draft.\n1. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.\n1. When the post is approved, it gets published.\n1. Only published blog posts return content to print so that unapproved posts\n   can\u2019t accidentally be published.\n\nAny other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For example, if we\ntry to approve a draft blog post before we\u2019ve requested a review, the post\nshould remain an unpublished draft.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "There are infinite ways to structure code to solve the same problem, each with\ndifferent trade-offs. This section\u2019s implementation is more of a traditional\nobject-oriented style, which is possible to write in Rust, but doesn\u2019t take\nadvantage of some of Rust\u2019s strengths. Later, we\u2019ll demonstrate a different\nsolution that still uses the object-oriented design pattern but is structured\nin a way that might look less familiar to programmers with object-oriented\nexperience. We\u2019ll compare the two solutions to experience the trade-offs of\ndesigning Rust code differently than code in other languages.\n\nListing 18-11 shows this workflow in code form: This is an example usage of the\nAPI we\u2019ll implement in a library crate named `blog`. This won\u2019t compile yet\nbecause we haven\u2019t implemented the `blog` crate.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Code that demonstrates the desired behavior we want our `blog` crate to have\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-11/src/main.rs:all}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe want to allow the user to create a new draft blog post with `Post::new`. We\nwant to allow text to be added to the blog post. If we try to get the post\u2019s\ncontent immediately, before approval, we shouldn\u2019t get any text because the\npost is still a draft. We\u2019ve added `assert_eq!` in the code for demonstration\npurposes. An excellent unit test for this would be to assert that a draft blog\npost returns an empty string from the `content` method, but we\u2019re not going to\nwrite tests for this example.\n\nNext, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want\n`content` to return an empty string while waiting for the review. When the post\nreceives approval, it should get published, meaning the text of the post will\nbe returned when `content` is called.\n\nNotice that the only type we\u2019re interacting with from the crate is the `Post`\ntype. This type will use the state pattern and will hold a value that will be\none of three state objects representing the various states a post can be\nin\u2014draft, review, or published. Changing from one state to another will be\nmanaged internally within the `Post` type. The states change in response to the\nmethods called by our library\u2019s users on the `Post` instance, but they don\u2019t\nhave to manage the state changes directly. Also, users can\u2019t make a mistake\nwith the states, such as publishing a post before it\u2019s reviewed.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"defining-post-and-creating-a-new-instance-in-the-draft-state\"></a>\n\n#### Defining `Post` and Creating a New Instance\n\nLet\u2019s get started on the implementation of the library! We know we need a\npublic `Post` struct that holds some content, so we\u2019ll start with the\ndefinition of the struct and an associated public `new` function to create an\ninstance of `Post`, as shown in Listing 18-12. We\u2019ll also make a private\n`State` trait that will define the behavior that all state objects for a `Post`\nmust have.\n\nThen, `Post` will hold a trait object of `Box<dyn State>` inside an `Option<T>`\nin a private field named `state` to hold the state object. You\u2019ll see why the\n`Option<T>` is necessary in a bit.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-12\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Definition of a `Post` struct and a `new` function that creates a new `Post` instance, a `State` trait, and a `Draft` struct\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-12/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `State` trait defines the behavior shared by different post states. The\nstate objects are `Draft`, `PendingReview`, and `Published`, and they will all\nimplement the `State` trait. For now, the trait doesn\u2019t have any methods, and\nwe\u2019ll start by defining just the `Draft` state because that is the state we\nwant a post to start in.\n\nWhen we create a new `Post`, we set its `state` field to a `Some` value that\nholds a `Box`. This `Box` points to a new instance of the `Draft` struct. This\nensures that whenever we create a new instance of `Post`, it will start out as\na draft. Because the `state` field of `Post` is private, there is no way to\ncreate a `Post` in any other state! In the `Post::new` function, we set the\n`content` field to a new, empty `String`.\n\n#### Storing the Text of the Post Content\n\nWe saw in Listing 18-11 that we want to be able to call a method named\n`add_text` and pass it a `&str` that is then added as the text content of the\nblog post. We implement this as a method, rather than exposing the `content`\nfield as `pub`, so that later we can implement a method that will control how\nthe `content` field\u2019s data is read. The `add_text` method is pretty\nstraightforward, so let\u2019s add the implementation in Listing 18-13 to the `impl\nPost` block.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-13\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `add_text` method to add text to a post\u2019s `content`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-13/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `add_text` method takes a mutable reference to `self` because we\u2019re\nchanging the `Post` instance that we\u2019re calling `add_text` on. We then call\n`push_str` on the `String` in `content` and pass the `text` argument to add to\nthe saved `content`. This behavior doesn\u2019t depend on the state the post is in,\nso it\u2019s not part of the state pattern. The `add_text` method doesn\u2019t interact\nwith the `state` field at all, but it is part of the behavior we want to\nsupport.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ensuring-the-content-of-a-draft-post-is-empty\"></a>\n\n#### Ensuring That the Content of a Draft Post Is Empty\n\nEven after we\u2019ve called `add_text` and added some content to our post, we still\nwant the `content` method to return an empty string slice because the post is\nstill in the draft state, as shown by the first `assert_eq!` in Listing 18-11.\nFor now, let\u2019s implement the `content` method with the simplest thing that will\nfulfill this requirement: always returning an empty string slice. We\u2019ll change\nthis later once we implement the ability to change a post\u2019s state so that it\ncan be published. So far, posts can only be in the draft state, so the post\ncontent should always be empty. Listing 18-14 shows this placeholder\nimplementation.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-14\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding a placeholder implementation for the `content` method on `Post` that always returns an empty string slice\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-14/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWith this added `content` method, everything in Listing 18-11 through the first\n`assert_eq!` works as intended.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"requesting-a-review-of-the-post-changes-its-state\"></a>\n<a id=\"requesting-a-review-changes-the-posts-state\"></a>\n\n#### Requesting a Review, Which Changes the Post\u2019s State\n\nNext, we need to add functionality to request a review of a post, which should\nchange its state from `Draft` to `PendingReview`. Listing 18-15 shows this code.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-15\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing `request_review` methods on `Post` and the `State` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-15/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe give `Post` a public method named `request_review` that will take a mutable\nreference to `self`. Then, we call an internal `request_review` method on the\ncurrent state of `Post`, and this second `request_review` method consumes the\ncurrent state and returns a new state.\n\nWe add the `request_review` method to the `State` trait; all types that\nimplement the trait will now need to implement the `request_review` method.\nNote that rather than having `self`, `&self`, or `&mut self` as the first\nparameter of the method, we have `self: Box<Self>`. This syntax means the\nmethod is only valid when called on a `Box` holding the type. This syntax takes\nownership of `Box<Self>`, invalidating the old state so that the state value of\nthe `Post` can transform into a new state.\n\nTo consume the old state, the `request_review` method needs to take ownership\nof the state value. This is where the `Option` in the `state` field of `Post`\ncomes in: We call the `take` method to take the `Some` value out of the `state`\nfield and leave a `None` in its place because Rust doesn\u2019t let us have\nunpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the `state` value out of\n`Post` rather than borrowing it. Then, we\u2019ll set the post\u2019s `state` value to\nthe result of this operation.\n\nWe need to set `state` to `None` temporarily rather than setting it directly\nwith code like `self.state = self.state.request_review();` to get ownership of\nthe `state` value. This ensures that `Post` can\u2019t use the old `state` value\nafter we\u2019ve transformed it into a new state.\n\nThe `request_review` method on `Draft` returns a new, boxed instance of a new\n`PendingReview` struct, which represents the state when a post is waiting for a\nreview. The `PendingReview` struct also implements the `request_review` method\nbut doesn\u2019t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself because when we\nrequest a review on a post already in the `PendingReview` state, it should stay\nin the `PendingReview` state.\n\nNow we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: The\n`request_review` method on `Post` is the same no matter its `state` value. Each\nstate is responsible for its own rules.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the `content` method on `Post` as is, returning an empty string\nslice. We can now have a `Post` in the `PendingReview` state as well as in the\n`Draft` state, but we want the same behavior in the `PendingReview` state.\nListing 18-11 now works up to the second `assert_eq!` call!\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"adding-the-approve-method-that-changes-the-behavior-of-content\"></a>\n<a id=\"adding-approve-to-change-the-behavior-of-content\"></a>\n\n#### Adding `approve` to Change `content`'s Behavior\n\nThe `approve` method will be similar to the `request_review` method: It will\nset `state` to the value that the current state says it should have when that\nstate is approved, as shown in Listing 18-16.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-16\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `approve` method on `Post` and the `State` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-16/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe add the `approve` method to the `State` trait and add a new struct that\nimplements `State`, the `Published` state.\n\nSimilar to the way `request_review` on `PendingReview` works, if we call the\n`approve` method on a `Draft`, it will have no effect because `approve` will\nreturn `self`. When we call `approve` on `PendingReview`, it returns a new,\nboxed instance of the `Published` struct. The `Published` struct implements the\n`State` trait, and for both the `request_review` method and the `approve`\nmethod, it returns itself because the post should stay in the `Published` state\nin those cases.\n\nNow we need to update the `content` method on `Post`. We want the value\nreturned from `content` to depend on the current state of the `Post`, so we\u2019re\ngoing to have the `Post` delegate to a `content` method defined on its `state`,\nas shown in Listing 18-17.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-17\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Updating the `content` method on `Post` to delegate to a `content` method on `State`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-17/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nBecause the goal is to keep all of these rules inside the structs that\nimplement `State`, we call a `content` method on the value in `state` and pass\nthe post instance (that is, `self`) as an argument. Then, we return the value\nthat\u2019s returned from using the `content` method on the `state` value.\n\nWe call the `as_ref` method on the `Option` because we want a reference to the\nvalue inside the `Option` rather than ownership of the value. Because `state` is\nan `Option<Box<dyn State>>`, when we call `as_ref`, an `Option<&Box<dyn\nState>>` is returned. If we didn\u2019t call `as_ref`, we would get an error because\nwe can\u2019t move `state` out of the borrowed `&self` of the function parameter.\n\nWe then call the `unwrap` method, which we know will never panic because we\nknow the methods on `Post` ensure that `state` will always contain a `Some`\nvalue when those methods are done. This is one of the cases we talked about in\nthe [\u201cWhen You Have More Information Than the\nCompiler\u201d][more-info-than-rustc]<!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 9 when we\nknow that a `None` value is never possible, even though the compiler isn\u2019t able\nto understand that.\n\nAt this point, when we call `content` on the `&Box<dyn State>`, deref coercion\nwill take effect on the `&` and the `Box` so that the `content` method will\nultimately be called on the type that implements the `State` trait. That means\nwe need to add `content` to the `State` trait definition, and that is where\nwe\u2019ll put the logic for what content to return depending on which state we\nhave, as shown in Listing 18-18.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-18\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Adding the `content` method to the `State` trait\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-18/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe add a default implementation for the `content` method that returns an empty\nstring slice. That means we don\u2019t need to implement `content` on the `Draft`\nand `PendingReview` structs. The `Published` struct will override the `content`\nmethod and return the value in `post.content`. While convenient, having the\n`content` method on `State` determine the content of the `Post` is blurring\nthe lines between the responsibility of `State` and the responsibility of\n`Post`.\n\nNote that we need lifetime annotations on this method, as we discussed in\nChapter 10. We\u2019re taking a reference to a `post` as an argument and returning a\nreference to part of that `post`, so the lifetime of the returned reference is\nrelated to the lifetime of the `post` argument.\n\nAnd we\u2019re done\u2014all of Listing 18-11 now works! We\u2019ve implemented the state\npattern with the rules of the blog post workflow. The logic related to the\nrules lives in the state objects rather than being scattered throughout `Post`.\n\n> ### Why Not An Enum?\n>\n> You may have been wondering why we didn\u2019t use an enum with the different\n> possible post states as variants. That\u2019s certainly a possible solution; try it\n> and compare the end results to see which you prefer! One disadvantage of using\n> an enum is that every place that checks the value of the enum will need a\n> `match` expression or similar to handle every possible variant. This could get\n> more repetitive than this trait object solution.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"trade-offs-of-the-state-pattern\"></a>\n\n#### Evaluating the State Pattern\n\nWe\u2019ve shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented state\npattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in\neach state. The methods on `Post` know nothing about the various behaviors.\nBecause of the way we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to\nknow the different ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the\n`State` trait on the `Published` struct.\n\nIf we were to create an alternative implementation that didn\u2019t use the state\npattern, we might instead use `match` expressions in the methods on `Post` or\neven in the `main` code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior\nin those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to\nunderstand all the implications of a post being in the published state.\n\nWith the state pattern, the `Post` methods and the places we use `Post` don\u2019t\nneed `match` expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a\nnew struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct in one location.\n\nThe implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more\nfunctionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state\npattern, try a few of these suggestions:\n\n- Add a `reject` method that changes the post\u2019s state from `PendingReview` back\n  to `Draft`.\n- Require two calls to `approve` before the state can be changed to `Published`.\n- Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the `Draft` state.\n  Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the\n  content but not responsible for modifying the `Post`.\n\nOne downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement the\ntransitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we\nadd another state between `PendingReview` and `Published`, such as `Scheduled`,\nwe would have to change the code in `PendingReview` to transition to\n`Scheduled` instead. It would be less work if `PendingReview` didn\u2019t need to\nchange with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to\nanother design pattern.\n\nAnother downside is that we\u2019ve duplicated some logic. To eliminate some of the\nduplication, we might try to make default implementations for the\n`request_review` and `approve` methods on the `State` trait that return `self`.\nHowever, this wouldn\u2019t work: When using `State` as a trait object, the trait\ndoesn\u2019t know what the concrete `self` will be exactly, so the return type isn\u2019t\nknown at compile time. (This is one of the dyn compatibility rules mentioned\nearlier.)\n\nOther duplication includes the similar implementations of the `request_review`\nand `approve` methods on `Post`. Both methods use `Option::take` with the\n`state` field of `Post`, and if `state` is `Some`, they delegate to the wrapped\nvalue\u2019s implementation of the same method and set the new value of the `state`\nfield to the result. If we had a lot of methods on `Post` that followed this\npattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the repetition (see\nthe [\u201cMacros\u201d][macros]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 20).\n\nBy implementing the state pattern exactly as it\u2019s defined for object-oriented\nlanguages, we\u2019re not taking as full advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths as we could.\nLet\u2019s look at some changes we can make to the `blog` crate that can make\ninvalid states and transitions into compile-time errors.",

Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so\nthat outside code has no knowledge of them, we\u2019ll encode the states into\ndifferent types. Consequently, Rust\u2019s type-checking system will prevent\nattempts to use draft posts where only published posts are allowed by issuing a\ncompiler error.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the first part of `main` in Listing 18-11:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using `Post::new`\nand the ability to add text to the post\u2019s content. But instead of having a\n`content` method on a draft post that returns an empty string, we\u2019ll make it so\nthat draft posts don\u2019t have the `content` method at all. That way, if we try to\nget a draft post\u2019s content, we\u2019ll get a compiler error telling us the method\ndoesn\u2019t exist. As a result, it will be impossible for us to accidentally\ndisplay draft post content in production because that code won\u2019t even compile.\nListing 18-19 shows the definition of a `Post` struct and a `DraftPost` struct,\nas well as methods on each.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-19\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `Post` with a `content` method and a `DraftPost` without a `content` method\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-19/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nBoth the `Post` and `DraftPost` structs have a private `content` field that\nstores the blog post text. The structs no longer have the `state` field because\nwe\u2019re moving the encoding of the state to the types of the structs. The `Post`\nstruct will represent a published post, and it has a `content` method that\nreturns the `content`.\n\nWe still have a `Post::new` function, but instead of returning an instance of\n`Post`, it returns an instance of `DraftPost`. Because `content` is private and\nthere aren\u2019t any functions that return `Post`, it\u2019s not possible to create an\ninstance of `Post` right now.\n\nThe `DraftPost` struct has an `add_text` method, so we can add text to\n`content` as before, but note that `DraftPost` does not have a `content` method\ndefined! So now the program ensures that all posts start as draft posts, and\ndraft posts don\u2019t have their content available for display. Any attempt to get\naround these constraints will result in a compiler error.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"implementing-transitions-as-transformations-into-different-types\"></a>\n\nSo, how do we get a published post? We want to enforce the rule that a draft\npost has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published. A post in the\npending review state should still not display any content. Let\u2019s implement\nthese constraints by adding another struct, `PendingReviewPost`, defining the\n`request_review` method on `DraftPost` to return a `PendingReviewPost` and\ndefining an `approve` method on `PendingReviewPost` to return a `Post`, as\nshown in Listing 18-20.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-20\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A `PendingReviewPost` that gets created by calling `request_review` on `DraftPost` and an `approve` method that turns a `PendingReviewPost` into a published `Post`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-20/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `request_review` and `approve` methods take ownership of `self`, thus\nconsuming the `DraftPost` and `PendingReviewPost` instances and transforming\nthem into a `PendingReviewPost` and a published `Post`, respectively. This way,\nwe won\u2019t have any lingering `DraftPost` instances after we\u2019ve called\n`request_review` on them, and so forth. The `PendingReviewPost` struct doesn\u2019t\nhave a `content` method defined on it, so attempting to read its content\nresults in a compiler error, as with `DraftPost`. Because the only way to get a\npublished `Post` instance that does have a `content` method defined is to call\nthe `approve` method on a `PendingReviewPost`, and the only way to get a\n`PendingReviewPost` is to call the `request_review` method on a `DraftPost`,\nwe\u2019ve now encoded the blog post workflow into the type system.\n\nBut we also have to make some small changes to `main`. The `request_review` and\n`approve` methods return new instances rather than modifying the struct they\u2019re\ncalled on, so we need to add more `let post =` shadowing assignments to save\nthe returned instances. We also can\u2019t have the assertions about the draft and\npending review posts\u2019 contents be empty strings, nor do we need them: We can\u2019t\ncompile code that tries to use the content of posts in those states any longer.\nThe updated code in `main` is shown in Listing 18-21.\n\n<Listing number=\"18-21\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Modifications to `main` to use the new implementation of the blog post workflow\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-21/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe changes we needed to make to `main` to reassign `post` mean that this\nimplementation doesn\u2019t quite follow the object-oriented state pattern anymore:\nThe transformations between the states are no longer encapsulated entirely\nwithin the `Post` implementation. However, our gain is that invalid states are\nnow impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens at\ncompile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as display of the content of\nan unpublished post, will be discovered before they make it to production.\n\nTry the tasks suggested at the start of this section on the `blog` crate as it\nis after Listing 18-21 to see what you think about the design of this version\nof the code. Note that some of the tasks might be completed already in this\ndesign.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that even though Rust is capable of implementing object-oriented\ndesign patterns, other patterns, such as encoding state into the type system,\nare also available in Rust. These patterns have different trade-offs. Although\nyou might be very familiar with object-oriented patterns, rethinking the\nproblem to take advantage of Rust\u2019s features can provide benefits, such as\npreventing some bugs at compile time. Object-oriented patterns won\u2019t always be\nthe best solution in Rust due to certain features, like ownership, that\nobject-oriented languages don\u2019t have.\n\n## Summary\n\nRegardless of whether you think Rust is an object-oriented language after\nreading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects to get some\nobject-oriented features in Rust. Dynamic dispatch can give your code some\nflexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. You can use this\nflexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code\u2019s\nmaintainability. Rust also has other features, like ownership, that\nobject-oriented languages don\u2019t have. An object-oriented pattern won\u2019t always\nbe the best way to take advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths, but it is an available\noption.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll look at patterns, which are another of Rust\u2019s features that enable\nlots of flexibility. We\u2019ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but\nhaven\u2019t seen their full capability yet.

    "content": "# Patterns and Matching\n\nPatterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of\ntypes, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with `match`\nexpressions and other constructs gives you more control over a program\u2019s\ncontrol flow. A pattern consists of some combination of the following:\n\n- Literals\n- Destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples\n- Variables\n- Wildcards\n- Placeholders\n\nSome example patterns include `x`, `(a, 3)`, and `Some(Color::Red)`. In the\ncontexts in which patterns are valid, these components describe the shape of\ndata. Our program then matches values against the patterns to determine whether\nit has the correct shape of data to continue running a particular piece of code.\n\nTo use a pattern, we compare it to some value. If the pattern matches the\nvalue, we use the value parts in our code. Recall the `match` expressions in\nChapter 6 that used patterns, such as the coin-sorting machine example. If the\nvalue fits the shape of the pattern, we can use the named pieces. If it\ndoesn\u2019t, the code associated with the pattern won\u2019t run.\n\nThis chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns. We\u2019ll cover the\nvalid places to use patterns, the difference between refutable and irrefutable\npatterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that you might see. By the\nend of the chapter, you\u2019ll know how to use patterns to express many concepts in\na clear way.",

    "content": "As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of `match` expressions.\nFormally, `match` expressions are defined as the keyword `match`, a value to\nmatch on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an\nexpression to run if the value matches that arm\u2019s pattern, like this:\n\n<!--\n  Manually formatted rather than using Markdown intentionally: Markdown does not\n  support italicizing code in the body of a block like this!\n-->\n\n<pre><code>match <em>VALUE</em> {\n    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,\n    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,\n    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,\n}</code></pre>\n\nFor example, here\u2019s the `match` expression from Listing 6-5 that matches on an\n`Option<i32>` value in the variable `x`:\n\n```rust,ignore\nmatch x {\n    None => None,\n    Some(i) => Some(i + 1),\n}\n```\n\nThe patterns in this `match` expression are the `None` and `Some(i)` to the\nleft of each arrow.\n\nOne requirement for `match` expressions is that they need to be exhaustive in\nthe sense that all possibilities for the value in the `match` expression must\nbe accounted for. One way to ensure that you\u2019ve covered every possibility is to\nhave a catch-all pattern for the last arm: For example, a variable name\nmatching any value can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.\n\nThe particular pattern `_` will match anything, but it never binds to a\nvariable, so it\u2019s often used in the last match arm. The `_` pattern can be\nuseful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We\u2019ll\ncover the `_` pattern in more detail in [\u201cIgnoring Values in a\nPattern\u201d][ignoring-values-in-a-pattern]<!-- ignore --> later in this chapter.",

    "title": "`let` Statements",
    "content": "Prior to this chapter, we had only explicitly discussed using patterns with\n`match` and `if let`, but in fact, we\u2019ve used patterns in other places as well,\nincluding in `let` statements. For example, consider this straightforward\nvariable assignment with `let`:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\n```\n\nEvery time you\u2019ve used a `let` statement like this you\u2019ve been using patterns,\nalthough you might not have realized it! More formally, a `let` statement looks\nlike this:\n\n<!--\n  Manually formatted rather than using Markdown intentionally: Markdown does not\n  support italicizing code in the body of a block like this!\n-->\n\n<pre>\n<code>let <em>PATTERN</em> = <em>EXPRESSION</em>;</code>\n</pre>\n\nIn statements like `let x = 5;` with a variable name in the PATTERN slot, the\nvariable name is just a particularly simple form of a pattern. Rust compares\nthe expression against the pattern and assigns any names it finds. So, in the\n`let x = 5;` example, `x` is a pattern that means \u201cbind what matches here to\nthe variable `x`.\u201d Because the name `x` is the whole pattern, this pattern\neffectively means \u201cbind everything to the variable `x`, whatever the value is.\u201d\n\nTo see the pattern-matching aspect of `let` more clearly, consider Listing\n19-1, which uses a pattern with `let` to destructure a tuple.\n\n\n<Listing number=\"19-1\" caption=\"Using a pattern to destructure a tuple and create three variables at once\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-01/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we match a tuple against a pattern. Rust compares the value `(1, 2, 3)`\nto the pattern `(x, y, z)` and sees that the value matches the pattern\u2014that is,\nit sees that the number of elements is the same in both\u2014so Rust binds `1` to\n`x`, `2` to `y`, and `3` to `z`. You can think of this tuple pattern as nesting\nthree individual variable patterns inside it.\n\nIf the number of elements in the pattern doesn\u2019t match the number of elements\nin the tuple, the overall type won\u2019t match and we\u2019ll get a compiler error. For\nexample, Listing 19-2 shows an attempt to destructure a tuple with three\nelements into two variables, which won\u2019t work.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-2\" caption=\"Incorrectly constructing a pattern whose variables don\u2019t match the number of elements in the tuple\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAttempting to compile this code results in this type error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-02/output.txt}}\n```\n\nTo fix the error, we could ignore one or more of the values in the tuple using\n`_` or `..`, as you\u2019ll see in the [\u201cIgnoring Values in a\nPattern\u201d][ignoring-values-in-a-pattern]<!-- ignore --> section. If the problem\nis that we have too many variables in the pattern, the solution is to make the\ntypes match by removing variables so that the number of variables equals the\nnumber of elements in the tuple.",

Doing so gives us more flexibility than a\n`match` expression in which we can express only one value to compare with the\npatterns. Also, Rust doesn\u2019t require that the conditions in a series of `if\nlet`, `else if`, and `else if let` arms relate to each other.\n\nThe code in Listing 19-3 determines what color to make your background based on\na series of checks for several conditions. For this example, we\u2019ve created\nvariables with hardcoded values that a real program might receive from user\ninput.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-3\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Mixing `if let`, `else if`, `else if let`, and `else`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-03/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf the user specifies a favorite color, that color is used as the background.\nIf no favorite color is specified and today is Tuesday, the background color is\ngreen. Otherwise, if the user specifies their age as a string and we can parse\nit as a number successfully, the color is either purple or orange depending on\nthe value of the number. If none of these conditions apply, the background\ncolor is blue.\n\nThis conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. With the\nhardcoded values we have here, this example will print `Using purple as the\nbackground color`.\n\nYou can see that `if let` can also introduce new variables that shadow existing\nvariables in the same way that `match` arms can: The line `if let Ok(age) = age`\nintroduces a new `age` variable that contains the value inside the `Ok` variant,\nshadowing the existing `age` variable. This means we need to place the `if age >\n30` condition within that block: We can\u2019t combine these two conditions into `if\nlet Ok(age) = age && age > 30`. The new `age` we want to compare to 30 isn\u2019t\nvalid until the new scope starts with the curly bracket.\n\nThe downside of using `if let` expressions is that the compiler doesn\u2019t check\nfor exhaustiveness, whereas with `match` expressions it does. If we omitted the\nlast `else` block and therefore missed handling some cases, the compiler would\nnot alert us to the possible logic bug.",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "## Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match\n\nPatterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will match\nfor any possible value passed are _irrefutable_. An example would be `x` in the\nstatement `let x = 5;` because `x` matches anything and therefore cannot fail\nto match. Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are\n_refutable_. An example would be `Some(x)` in the expression `if let Some(x) =\na_value` because if the value in the `a_value` variable is `None` rather than\n`Some`, the `Some(x)` pattern will not match.\n\nFunction parameters, `let` statements, and `for` loops can only accept\nirrefutable patterns because the program cannot do anything meaningful when\nvalues don\u2019t match. The `if let` and `while let` expressions and the\n`let...else` statement accept refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the\ncompiler warns against irrefutable patterns because, by definition, they\u2019re\nintended to handle possible failure: The functionality of a conditional is in\nits ability to perform differently depending on success or failure.\n\nIn general, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about the distinction between refutable\nand irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar with the concept\nof refutability so that you can respond when you see it in an error message. In\nthose cases, you\u2019ll need to change either the pattern or the construct you\u2019re\nusing the pattern with, depending on the intended behavior of the code.\n\nLet\u2019s look at an example of what happens when we try to use a refutable pattern\nwhere Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. Listing 19-8 shows a\n`let` statement, but for the pattern, we\u2019ve specified `Some(x)`, a refutable\npattern. As you might expect, this code will not compile.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-8\" caption=\"Attempting to use a refutable pattern with `let`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-08/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIf `some_option_value` were a `None` value, it would fail to match the pattern\n`Some(x)`, meaning the pattern is refutable. However, the `let` statement can\nonly accept an irrefutable pattern because there is nothing valid the code can\ndo with a `None` value. At compile time, Rust will complain that we\u2019ve tried to\nuse a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is required:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-08/output.txt}}\n```\n\nBecause we didn\u2019t cover (and couldn\u2019t cover!) every valid value with the\npattern `Some(x)`, Rust rightfully produces a compiler error.\n\nIf we have a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is needed, we can\nfix it by changing the code that uses the pattern: Instead of using `let`, we\ncan use `let...else`. Then, if the pattern doesn\u2019t match, the code in the curly\nbrackets will handle the value. Listing 19-9 shows how to fix the code in\nListing 19-8.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-9\" caption=\"Using `let...else` and a block with refutable patterns instead of `let`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-09/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve given the code an out! This code is perfectly valid, although it means we\ncannot use an irrefutable pattern without receiving a warning. If we give\n`let...else` a pattern that will always match, such as `x`, as shown in Listing\n19-10, the compiler will give a warning.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-10\" caption=\"Attempting to use an irrefutable pattern with `let...else`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-10/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRust complains that it doesn\u2019t make sense to use `let...else` with an\nirrefutable pattern:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-10/output.txt}}\n```\n\nFor this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for the last\narm, which should match any remaining values with an irrefutable pattern. Rust\nallows us to use an irrefutable pattern in a `match` with only one arm, but\nthis syntax isn\u2019t particularly useful and could be replaced with a simpler\n`let` statement.\n\nNow that you know where to use patterns and the difference between refutable\nand irrefutable patterns, let\u2019s cover all the syntax we can use to create\npatterns.",

However, there is a complication when you use\nnamed variables in `match`, `if let`, or `while let` expressions. Because each\nof these kinds of expressions starts a new scope, variables declared as part of\na pattern inside these expressions will shadow those with the same name outside\nthe constructs, as is the case with all variables. In Listing 19-11, we declare\na variable named `x` with the value `Some(5)` and a variable `y` with the value\n`10`. We then create a `match` expression on the value `x`. Look at the\npatterns in the match arms and `println!` at the end, and try to figure out\nwhat the code will print before running this code or reading further.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A `match` expression with an arm that introduces a new variable which shadows an existing variable `y`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what happens when the `match` expression runs. The pattern\nin the first match arm doesn\u2019t match the defined value of `x`, so the code\ncontinues.\n\nThe pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named `y` that\nwill match any value inside a `Some` value. Because we\u2019re in a new scope inside\nthe `match` expression, this is a new `y` variable, not the `y` we declared at\nthe beginning with the value `10`. This new `y` binding will match any value\ninside a `Some`, which is what we have in `x`. Therefore, this new `y` binds to\nthe inner value of the `Some` in `x`. That value is `5`, so the expression for\nthat arm executes and prints `Matched, y = 5`.\n\nIf `x` had been a `None` value instead of `Some(5)`, the patterns in the first\ntwo arms wouldn\u2019t have matched, so the value would have matched to the\nunderscore. We didn\u2019t introduce the `x` variable in the pattern of the\nunderscore arm, so the `x` in the expression is still the outer `x` that hasn\u2019t\nbeen shadowed. In this hypothetical case, the `match` would print `Default case,\nx = None`.\n\nWhen the `match` expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the scope of\nthe inner `y`. The last `println!` produces `at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10`.\n\nTo create a `match` expression that compares the values of the outer `x` and\n`y`, rather than introducing a new variable that shadows the existing `y`\nvariable, we would need to use a match guard conditional instead.

This example shows that the names of the\nvariables in the pattern don\u2019t have to match the field names of the struct.\nHowever, it\u2019s common to match the variable names to the field names to make it\neasier to remember which variables came from which fields. Because of this\ncommon usage, and because writing `let Point { x: x, y: y } = p;` contains a\nlot of duplication, Rust has a shorthand for patterns that match struct fields:\nYou only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables created\nfrom the pattern will have the same names. Listing 19-13 behaves in the same\nway as the code in Listing 19-12, but the variables created in the `let`\npattern are `x` and `y` instead of `a` and `b`.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-13\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Destructuring struct fields using struct field shorthand\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-13/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code creates the variables `x` and `y` that match the `x` and `y` fields\nof the `p` variable. The outcome is that the variables `x` and `y` contain the\nvalues from the `p` struct.\n\nWe can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern\nrather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test\nsome of the fields for particular values while creating variables to\ndestructure the other fields.\n\nIn Listing 19-14, we have a `match` expression that separates `Point` values\ninto three cases: points that lie directly on the `x` axis (which is true when\n`y = 0`), on the `y` axis (`x = 0`), or on neither axis.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-14\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Destructuring and matching literal values in one pattern\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-14/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe first arm will match any point that lies on the `x` axis by specifying that\nthe `y` field matches if its value matches the literal `0`. The pattern still\ncreates an `x` variable that we can use in the code for this arm.\n\nSimilarly, the second arm matches any point on the `y` axis by specifying that\nthe `x` field matches if its value is `0` and creates a variable `y` for the\nvalue of the `y` field. The third arm doesn\u2019t specify any literals, so it\nmatches any other `Point` and creates variables for both the `x` and `y` fields.\n\nIn this example, the value `p` matches the second arm by virtue of `x`\ncontaining a `0`, so this code will print `On the y axis at 7`.\n\nRemember that a `match` expression stops checking arms once it has found the\nfirst matching pattern, so even though `Point { x: 0, y: 0 }` is on the `x` axis\nand the `y` axis, this code would only print `On the x axis at 0`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

As an\nexample, in Listing 19-15, we use the `Message` enum from Listing 6-2 and write\na `match` with patterns that will destructure each inner value.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-15\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Destructuring enum variants that hold different kinds of values\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-15/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `Change color to red 0, green 160, and blue 255`. Try\nchanging the value of `msg` to see the code from the other arms run.\n\nFor enum variants without any data, like `Message::Quit`, we can\u2019t destructure\nthe value any further. We can only match on the literal `Message::Quit` value,\nand no variables are in that pattern.\n\nFor struct-like enum variants, such as `Message::Move`, we can use a pattern\nsimilar to the pattern we specify to match structs. After the variant name, we\nplace curly brackets and then list the fields with variables so that we break\napart the pieces to use in the code for this arm. Here we use the shorthand\nform as we did in Listing 19-13.\n\nFor tuple-like enum variants, like `Message::Write` that holds a tuple with one\nelement and `Message::ChangeColor` that holds a tuple with three elements, the\npattern is similar to the pattern we specify to match tuples. The number of\nvariables in the pattern must match the number of elements in the variant we\u2019re\nmatching.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"destructuring-nested-structs-and-enums\"></a>\n\n#### Nested Structs and Enums\n\nSo far, our examples have all been matching structs or enums one level deep,\nbut matching can work on nested items too! For example, we can refactor the\ncode in Listing 19-15 to support RGB and HSV colors in the `ChangeColor`\nmessage, as shown in Listing 19-16.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-16\" caption=\"Matching on nested enums\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-16/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe pattern of the first arm in the `match` expression matches a\n`Message::ChangeColor` enum variant that contains a `Color::Rgb` variant; then,\nthe pattern binds to the three inner `i32` values. The pattern of the second\narm also matches a `Message::ChangeColor` enum variant, but the inner enum\nmatches `Color::Hsv` instead. We can specify these complex conditions in one\n`match` expression, even though two enums are involved.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"destructuring-structs-and-tuples\"></a>\n\n#### Structs and Tuples\n\nWe can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways.\nThe following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs and\ntuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/no-listing-05-destructuring-structs-and-tuples/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis code lets us break complex types into their component parts so that we can\nuse the values we\u2019re interested in separately.\n\nDestructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values, such\nas the value from each field in a struct, separately from each other.",

There are a few\nways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the `_`\npattern (which you\u2019ve seen), using the `_` pattern within another pattern,\nusing a name that starts with an underscore, or using `..` to ignore remaining\nparts of a value. Let\u2019s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_\"></a>\n\n#### An Entire Value with `_`\n\nWe\u2019ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but\nnot bind to the value. This is especially useful as the last arm in a `match`\nexpression, but we can also use it in any pattern, including function\nparameters, as shown in Listing 19-17.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-17\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using `_` in a function signature\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-17/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will completely ignore the value `3` passed as the first argument,\nand will print `This code only uses the y parameter: 4`.\n\nIn most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, you\nwould change the signature so that it doesn\u2019t include the unused parameter.\nIgnoring a function parameter can be especially useful in cases when, for\nexample, you\u2019re implementing a trait when you need a certain type signature but\nthe function body in your implementation doesn\u2019t need one of the parameters.\nYou then avoid getting a compiler warning about unused function parameters, as\nyou would if you used a name instead.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ignoring-parts-of-a-value-with-a-nested-_\"></a>\n\n#### Parts of a Value with a Nested `_`\n\nWe can also use `_` inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for\nexample, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the\nother parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 19-18 shows code\nresponsible for managing a setting\u2019s value. The business requirements are that\nthe user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a\nsetting but can unset the setting and give it a value if it is currently unset.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-18\" caption=\"Using an underscore within patterns that match `Some` variants when we don\u2019t need to use the value inside the `Some`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-18/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `Can't overwrite an existing customized value` and then\n`setting is Some(5)`. In the first match arm, we don\u2019t need to match on or use\nthe values inside either `Some` variant, but we do need to test for the case\nwhen `setting_value` and `new_setting_value` are the `Some` variant. In that\ncase, we print the reason for not changing `setting_value`, and it doesn\u2019t get\nchanged.\n\nIn all other cases (if either `setting_value` or `new_setting_value` is `None`)\nexpressed by the `_` pattern in the second arm, we want to allow\n`new_setting_value` to become `setting_value`.\n\nWe can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore\nparticular values. Listing 19-19 shows an example of ignoring the second and\nfourth values in a tuple of five items.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-19\" caption=\"Ignoring multiple parts of a tuple\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-19/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `Some numbers: 2, 8, 32`, and the values `4` and `16` will\nbe ignored.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"ignoring-an-unused-variable-by-starting-its-name-with-_\"></a>\n\n#### An Unused Variable by Starting Its Name with `_`\n\nIf you create a variable but don\u2019t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a\nwarning because an unused variable could be a bug. However, sometimes it\u2019s\nuseful to be able to create a variable you won\u2019t use yet, such as when you\u2019re\nprototyping or just starting a project. In this situation, you can tell Rust\nnot to warn you about the unused variable by starting the name of the variable\nwith an underscore. In Listing 19-20, we create two unused variables, but when\nwe compile this code, we should only get a warning about one of them.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-20\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Starting a variable name with an underscore to avoid getting unused variable warnings\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-20/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we get a warning about not using the variable `y`, but we don\u2019t get a\nwarning about not using `_x`.\n\nNote that there is a subtle difference between using only `_` and using a name\nthat starts with an underscore. The syntax `_x` still binds the value to the\nvariable, whereas `_` doesn\u2019t bind at all. To show a case where this\ndistinction matters, Listing 19-21 will provide us with an error.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-21\" caption=\"An unused variable starting with an underscore still binds the value, which might take ownership of the value.\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-21/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ll receive an error because the `s` value will still be moved into `_s`,\nwhich prevents us from using `s` again. However, using the underscore by itself\ndoesn\u2019t ever bind to the value. Listing 19-22 will compile without any errors\nbecause `s` doesn\u2019t get moved into `_`.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-22\" caption=\"Using an underscore does not bind the value.\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-22/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code works just fine because we never bind `s` to anything; it isn\u2019t moved.\n\n<a id=\"ignoring-remaining-parts-of-a-value-with-\"></a>\n\n#### Remaining Parts of a Value with `..`\n\nWith values that have many parts, we can use the `..` syntax to use specific\nparts and ignore the rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each\nignored value. The `..` pattern ignores any parts of a value that we haven\u2019t\nexplicitly matched in the rest of the pattern. In Listing 19-23, we have a\n`Point` struct that holds a coordinate in three-dimensional space. In the\n`match` expression, we want to operate only on the `x` coordinate and ignore\nthe values in the `y` and `z` fields.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-23\" caption=\"Ignoring all fields of a `Point` except for `x` by using `..`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-23/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe list the `x` value and then just include the `..` pattern. This is quicker\nthan having to list `y: _` and `z: _`, particularly when we\u2019re working with\nstructs that have lots of fields in situations where only one or two fields are\nrelevant.\n\nThe syntax `..` will expand to as many values as it needs to be. Listing 19-24\nshows how to use `..` with a tuple.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-24\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Matching only the first and last values in a tuple and ignoring all other values\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-24/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn this code, the first and last values are matched with `first` and `last`.\nThe `..` will match and ignore everything in the middle.\n\nHowever, using `..` must be unambiguous. If it is unclear which values are\nintended for matching and which should be ignored, Rust will give us an error.\nListing 19-25 shows an example of using `..` ambiguously, so it will not\ncompile.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-25\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"An attempt to use `..` in an ambiguous way\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-25/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we compile this example, we get this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-25/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for Rust to determine how many values in the tuple to ignore\nbefore matching a value with `second` and then how many further values to\nignore thereafter. This code could mean that we want to ignore `2`, bind\n`second` to `4`, and then ignore `8`, `16`, and `32`; or that we want to ignore\n`2` and `4`, bind `second` to `8`, and then ignore `16` and `32`; and so forth.\nThe variable name `second` doesn\u2019t mean anything special to Rust, so we get a\ncompiler error because using `..` in two places like this is ambiguous.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "A _match guard_ is an additional `if` condition, specified after the pattern in\na `match` arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are\nuseful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows. Note,\nhowever, that they are only available in `match` expressions, not `if let` or\n`while let` expressions.\n\nThe condition can use variables created in the pattern. Listing 19-26 shows a\n`match` where the first arm has the pattern `Some(x)` and also has a match\nguard of `if x % 2 == 0` (which will be `true` if the number is even).\n\n<Listing number=\"19-26\" caption=\"Adding a match guard to a pattern\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-26/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis example will print `The number 4 is even`. When `num` is compared to the\npattern in the first arm, it matches because `Some(4)` matches `Some(x)`. Then,\nthe match guard checks whether the remainder of dividing `x` by 2 is equal to\n0, and because it is, the first arm is selected.\n\nIf `num` had been `Some(5)` instead, the match guard in the first arm would\nhave been `false` because the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1, which is not\nequal to 0. Rust would then go to the second arm, which would match because the\nsecond arm doesn\u2019t have a match guard and therefore matches any `Some` variant.\n\nThere is no way to express the `if x % 2 == 0` condition within a pattern, so\nthe match guard gives us the ability to express this logic. The downside of\nthis additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn\u2019t try to check for\nexhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.\n\nWhen discussing Listing 19-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to\nsolve our pattern-shadowing problem. Recall that we created a new variable\ninside the pattern in the `match` expression instead of using the variable\noutside the `match`. That new variable meant we couldn\u2019t test against the value\nof the outer variable. Listing 19-27 shows how we can use a match guard to fix\nthis problem.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-27\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using a match guard to test for equality with an outer variable\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-27/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will now print `Default case, x = Some(5)`. The pattern in the second\nmatch arm doesn\u2019t introduce a new variable `y` that would shadow the outer `y`,\nmeaning we can use the outer `y` in the match guard. Instead of specifying the\npattern as `Some(y)`, which would have shadowed the outer `y`, we specify\n`Some(n)`. This creates a new variable `n` that doesn\u2019t shadow anything because\nthere is no `n` variable outside the `match`.\n\nThe match guard `if n == y` is not a pattern and therefore doesn\u2019t introduce new\nvariables. This `y` _is_ the outer `y` rather than a new `y` shadowing it, and\nwe can look for a value that has the same value as the outer `y` by comparing\n`n` to `y`.\n\nYou can also use the _or_ operator `|` in a match guard to specify multiple\npatterns; the match guard condition will apply to all the patterns. Listing\n19-28 shows the precedence when combining a pattern that uses `|` with a match\nguard. The important part of this example is that the `if y` match guard\napplies to `4`, `5`, _and_ `6`, even though it might look like `if y` only\napplies to `6`.\n\n<Listing number=\"19-28\" caption=\"Combining multiple patterns with a match guard\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch19-patterns-and-matching/listing-19-28/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of `x` is\nequal to `4`, `5`, or `6` _and_ if `y` is `true`. When this code runs, the\npattern of the first arm matches because `x` is `4`, but the match guard `if y`\nis `false`, so the first arm is not chosen. The code moves on to the second\narm, which does match, and this program prints `no`. The reason is that the\n`if` condition applies to the whole pattern `4 | 5 | 6`, not just to the last\nvalue `6`. In other words, the precedence of a match guard in relation to a\npattern behaves like this:\n\n```text\n(4 | 5 | 6) if y => ...\n```\n\nrather than this:\n\n```text\n4 | 5 | (6 if y) => ...\n```\n\nAfter running the code, the precedence behavior is evident: If the match guard\nwere applied only to the final value in the list of values specified using the\n`|` operator, the arm would have matched, and the program would have printed\n`yes`.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it\nthat doesn\u2019t enforce these memory safety guarantees: It\u2019s called _unsafe Rust_\nand works just like regular Rust but gives us extra superpowers.\n\nUnsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. When\nthe compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees,\nit\u2019s better for it to reject some valid programs than to accept some invalid\nprograms. Although the code _might_ be okay, if the Rust compiler doesn\u2019t have\nenough information to be confident, it will reject the code. In these cases,\nyou can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, \u201cTrust me, I know what I\u2019m\ndoing.\u201d Be warned, however, that you use unsafe Rust at your own risk: If you\nuse unsafe code incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety, such as\nnull pointer dereferencing.\n\nAnother reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer\nhardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn\u2019t let you do unsafe operations, you\ncouldn\u2019t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems\nprogramming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even\nwriting your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming\nis one of the goals of the language. Let\u2019s explore what we can do with unsafe\nRust and how to do it.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "To switch to unsafe Rust, use the `unsafe` keyword and then start a new block\nthat holds the unsafe code. You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you\ncan\u2019t in safe Rust, which we call _unsafe superpowers_. Those superpowers\ninclude the ability to:\n\n1. Dereference a raw pointer.\n1. Call an unsafe function or method.\n1. Access or modify a mutable static variable.\n1. Implement an unsafe trait.\n1. Access fields of `union`s.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that `unsafe` doesn\u2019t turn off the borrow checker\nor disable any of Rust\u2019s other safety checks: If you use a reference in unsafe\ncode, it will still be checked. The `unsafe` keyword only gives you access to\nthese five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory\nsafety. You\u2019ll still get some degree of safety inside an unsafe block.\n\nIn addition, `unsafe` does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily\ndangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: The intent is\nthat as the programmer, you\u2019ll ensure that the code inside an `unsafe` block\nwill access memory in a valid way.\n\nPeople are fallible and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these five\nunsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with `unsafe`, you\u2019ll know that\nany errors related to memory safety must be within an `unsafe` block. Keep\n`unsafe` blocks small; you\u2019ll be thankful later when you investigate memory\nbugs.\n\nTo isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it\u2019s best to enclose such code\nwithin a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we\u2019ll discuss later in\nthe chapter when we examine unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the standard\nlibrary are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has been\naudited. Wrapping unsafe code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of `unsafe`\nfrom leaking out into all the places that you or your users might want to use\nthe functionality implemented with `unsafe` code, because using a safe\nabstraction is safe.\n\nLet\u2019s look at each of the five unsafe superpowers in turn.

    "title": "Dereferencing a Raw Pointer",
    "content": "In Chapter 4, in the [\u201cDangling References\u201d][dangling-references]<!-- ignore\n--> section, we mentioned that the compiler ensures that references are always\nvalid. Unsafe Rust has two new types called _raw pointers_ that are similar to\nreferences. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and\nare written as `*const T` and `*mut T`, respectively. The asterisk isn\u2019t the\ndereference operator; it\u2019s part of the type name. In the context of raw\npointers, _immutable_ means that the pointer can\u2019t be directly assigned to\nafter being dereferenced.\n\nDifferent from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:\n\n- Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and\n  mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location\n- Aren\u2019t guaranteed to point to valid memory\n- Are allowed to be null\n- Don\u2019t implement any automatic cleanup\n\nBy opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up\nguaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to\ninterface with another language or hardware where Rust\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t apply.\n\nListing 20-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-1\" caption=\"Creating raw pointers with the raw borrow operators\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-01/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNotice that we don\u2019t include the `unsafe` keyword in this code. We can create\nraw pointers in safe code; we just can\u2019t dereference raw pointers outside an\nunsafe block, as you\u2019ll see in a bit.\n\nWe\u2019ve created raw pointers by using the raw borrow operators: `&raw const num`\ncreates a `*const i32` immutable raw pointer, and `&raw mut num` creates a `*mut\ni32` mutable raw pointer. Because we created them directly from a local\nvariable, we know these particular raw pointers are valid, but we can\u2019t make\nthat assumption about just any raw pointer.\n\nTo demonstrate this, next we\u2019ll create a raw pointer whose validity we can\u2019t be\nso certain of, using the keyword `as` to cast a value instead of using the raw\nborrow operator. Listing 20-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary\nlocation in memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: There might be\ndata at that address or there might not, the compiler might optimize the code\nso that there is no memory access, or the program might terminate with a\nsegmentation fault. Usually, there is no good reason to write code like this,\nespecially in cases where you can use a raw borrow operator instead, but it is\npossible.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-2\" caption=\"Creating a raw pointer to an arbitrary memory address\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-02/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRecall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can\u2019t dereference\nraw pointers and read the data being pointed to. In Listing 20-3, we use the\ndereference operator `*` on a raw pointer that requires an `unsafe` block.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-3\" caption=\"Dereferencing raw pointers within an `unsafe` block\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-03/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nCreating a pointer does no harm; it\u2019s only when we try to access the value that\nit points at that we might end up dealing with an invalid value.\n\nNote also that in Listings 20-1 and 20-3, we created `*const i32` and `*mut\ni32` raw pointers that both pointed to the same memory location, where `num` is\nstored. If we instead tried to create an immutable and a mutable reference to\n`num`, the code would not have compiled because Rust\u2019s ownership rules don\u2019t\nallow a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable references. With\nraw pointers, we can create a mutable pointer and an immutable pointer to the\nsame location and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially creating\na data race. Be careful!\n\nWith all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers? One major use\ncase is when interfacing with C code, as you\u2019ll see in the next section.\nAnother case is when building up safe abstractions that the borrow checker\ndoesn\u2019t understand. We\u2019ll introduce unsafe functions and then look at an\nexample of a safe abstraction that uses unsafe code.",

    "title": "Calling an Unsafe Function or Method",
    "content": "The second type of operation you can perform in an unsafe block is calling\nunsafe functions. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular\nfunctions and methods, but they have an extra `unsafe` before the rest of the\ndefinition. The `unsafe` keyword in this context indicates the function has\nrequirements we need to uphold when we call this function, because Rust can\u2019t\nguarantee we\u2019ve met these requirements. By calling an unsafe function within an\n`unsafe` block, we\u2019re saying that we\u2019ve read this function\u2019s documentation and\nwe take responsibility for upholding the function\u2019s contracts.\n\nHere is an unsafe function named `dangerous` that doesn\u2019t do anything in its\nbody:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-01-unsafe-fn/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nWe must call the `dangerous` function within a separate `unsafe` block. If we\ntry to call `dangerous` without the `unsafe` block, we\u2019ll get an error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/output-only-01-missing-unsafe/output.txt}}\n```\n\nWith the `unsafe` block, we\u2019re asserting to Rust that we\u2019ve read the function\u2019s\ndocumentation, we understand how to use it properly, and we\u2019ve verified that\nwe\u2019re fulfilling the contract of the function.\n\nTo perform unsafe operations in the body of an `unsafe` function, you still\nneed to use an `unsafe` block, just as within a regular function, and the\ncompiler will warn you if you forget. This helps us keep `unsafe` blocks as\nsmall as possible, as unsafe operations may not be needed across the whole\nfunction body.\n\n#### Creating a Safe Abstraction over Unsafe Code\n\nJust because a function contains unsafe code doesn\u2019t mean we need to mark the\nentire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe function is\na common abstraction. As an example, let\u2019s study the `split_at_mut` function\nfrom the standard library, which requires some unsafe code. We\u2019ll explore how\nwe might implement it. This safe method is defined on mutable slices: It takes\none slice and makes it two by splitting the slice at the index given as an\nargument. Listing 20-4 shows how to use `split_at_mut`.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-4\" caption=\"Using the safe `split_at_mut` function\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-04/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe can\u2019t implement this function using only safe Rust. An attempt might look\nsomething like Listing 20-5, which won\u2019t compile. For simplicity, we\u2019ll\nimplement `split_at_mut` as a function rather than a method and only for slices\nof `i32` values rather than for a generic type `T`.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-5\" caption=\"An attempted implementation of `split_at_mut` using only safe Rust\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-05/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis function first gets the total length of the slice. Then, it asserts that\nthe index given as a parameter is within the slice by checking whether it\u2019s\nless than or equal to the length. The assertion means that if we pass an index\nthat is greater than the length to split the slice at, the function will panic\nbefore it attempts to use that index.\n\nThen, we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the\noriginal slice to the `mid` index and another from `mid` to the end of the\nslice.\n\nWhen we try to compile the code in Listing 20-5, we\u2019ll get an error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-05/output.txt}}\n```\n\nRust\u2019s borrow checker can\u2019t understand that we\u2019re borrowing different parts of\nthe slice; it only knows that we\u2019re borrowing from the same slice twice.\nBorrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay because the two\nslices aren\u2019t overlapping, but Rust isn\u2019t smart enough to know this. When we\nknow code is okay, but Rust doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s time to reach for unsafe code.\n\nListing 20-6 shows how to use an `unsafe` block, a raw pointer, and some calls\nto unsafe functions to make the implementation of `split_at_mut` work.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-6\" caption=\"Using unsafe code in the implementation of the `split_at_mut` function\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-06/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRecall from [\u201cThe Slice Type\u201d][the-slice-type]<!-- ignore --> section in\nChapter 4 that a slice is a pointer to some data and the length of the slice.\nWe use the `len` method to get the length of a slice and the `as_mut_ptr`\nmethod to access the raw pointer of a slice. In this case, because we have a\nmutable slice to `i32` values, `as_mut_ptr` returns a raw pointer with the type\n`*mut i32`, which we\u2019ve stored in the variable `ptr`.\n\nWe keep the assertion that the `mid` index is within the slice. Then, we get to\nthe unsafe code: The `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` function takes a raw pointer\nand a length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create a slice\nthat starts from `ptr` and is `mid` items long. Then, we call the `add` method\non `ptr` with `mid` as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at `mid`,\nand we create a slice using that pointer and the remaining number of items\nafter `mid` as the length.\n\nThe function `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` is unsafe because it takes a raw\npointer and must trust that this pointer is valid. The `add` method on raw\npointers is also unsafe because it must trust that the offset location is also\na valid pointer. Therefore, we had to put an `unsafe` block around our calls to\n`slice::from_raw_parts_mut` and `add` so that we could call them. By looking at\nthe code and by adding the assertion that `mid` must be less than or equal to\n`len`, we can tell that all the raw pointers used within the `unsafe` block\nwill be valid pointers to data within the slice. This is an acceptable and\nappropriate use of `unsafe`.\n\nNote that we don\u2019t need to mark the resultant `split_at_mut` function as\n`unsafe`, and we can call this function from safe Rust. We\u2019ve created a safe\nabstraction to the unsafe code with an implementation of the function that uses\n`unsafe` code in a safe way, because it creates only valid pointers from the\ndata this function has access to.\n\nIn contrast, the use of `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` in Listing 20-7 would\nlikely crash when the slice is used. This code takes an arbitrary memory\nlocation and creates a slice 10,000 items long.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-7\" caption=\"Creating a slice from an arbitrary memory location\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-07/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe don\u2019t own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there is no guarantee\nthat the slice this code creates contains valid `i32` values. Attempting to use\n`values` as though it\u2019s a valid slice results in undefined behavior.\n\n#### Using `extern` Functions to Call External Code\n\nSometimes your Rust code might need to interact with code written in another\nlanguage. For this, Rust has the keyword `extern` that facilitates the creation\nand use of a _Foreign Function Interface (FFI)_, which is a way for a\nprogramming language to define functions and enable a different (foreign)\nprogramming language to call those functions.\n\nListing 20-8 demonstrates how to set up an integration with the `abs` function\nfrom the C standard library. Functions declared within `extern` blocks are\ngenerally unsafe to call from Rust code, so `extern` blocks must also be marked\n`unsafe`. The reason is that other languages don\u2019t enforce Rust\u2019s rules and\nguarantees, and Rust can\u2019t check them, so responsibility falls on the\nprogrammer to ensure safety.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-8\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Declaring and calling an `extern` function defined in another language\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-08/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWithin the `unsafe extern \"C\"` block, we list the names and signatures of\nexternal functions from another language we want to call. The `\"C\"` part\ndefines which _application binary interface (ABI)_ the external function uses:\nThe ABI defines how to call the function at the assembly level. The `\"C\"` ABI\nis the most common and follows the C programming language\u2019s ABI. Information\nabout all the ABIs Rust supports is available in [the Rust Reference][ABI].\n\nEvery item declared within an `unsafe extern` block is implicitly unsafe.\nHowever, some FFI functions *are* safe to call. For example, the `abs` function\nfrom C\u2019s standard library does not have any memory safety considerations, and we\nknow it can be called with any `i32`. In cases like this, we can use the `safe`\nkeyword to say that this specific function is safe to call even though it is in\nan `unsafe extern` block. Once we make that change, calling it no longer\nrequires an `unsafe` block, as shown in Listing 20-9.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-9\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Explicitly marking a function as `safe` within an `unsafe extern` block and calling it safely\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-09/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nMarking a function as `safe` does not inherently make it safe! Instead, it is\nlike a promise you are making to Rust that it is safe. It is still your\nresponsibility to make sure that promise is kept!\n\n#### Calling Rust Functions from Other Languages\n\nWe can also use `extern` to create an interface that allows other languages to\ncall Rust functions. Instead of creating a whole `extern` block, we add the\n`extern` keyword and specify the ABI to use just before the `fn` keyword for\nthe relevant function. We also need to add an `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` annotation\nto tell the Rust compiler not to mangle the name of this function. _Mangling_\nis when a compiler changes the name we\u2019ve given a function to a different name\nthat contains more information for other parts of the compilation process to\nconsume but is less human readable. Every programming language compiler mangles\nnames slightly differently, so for a Rust function to be nameable by other\nlanguages, we must disable the Rust compiler\u2019s name mangling. This is unsafe\nbecause there might be name collisions across libraries without the built-in\nmangling, so it is our responsibility to make sure the name we choose is safe\nto export without mangling.\n\nIn the following example, we make the `call_from_c` function accessible from C\ncode, after it\u2019s compiled to a shared library and linked from C:\n\n```\n#[unsafe(no_mangle)]\npub extern \"C\" fn call_from_c() {\n    println!(\"Just called a Rust function from C!\");\n}\n```\n\nThis usage of `extern` requires `unsafe` only in the attribute, not on the\n`extern` block.",

    "content": "In this book, we\u2019ve not yet talked about global variables, which Rust does\nsupport but which can be problematic with Rust\u2019s ownership rules. If two\nthreads are accessing the same mutable global variable, it can cause a data\nrace.\n\nIn Rust, global variables are called _static_ variables. Listing 20-10 shows an\nexample declaration and use of a static variable with a string slice as a\nvalue.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Defining and using an immutable static variable\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-10/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nStatic variables are similar to constants, which we discussed in the\n[\u201cDeclaring Constants\u201d][constants]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 3. The\nnames of static variables are in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` by convention. Static\nvariables can only store references with the `'static` lifetime, which means\nthe Rust compiler can figure out the lifetime and we aren\u2019t required to\nannotate it explicitly. Accessing an immutable static variable is safe.\n\nA subtle difference between constants and immutable static variables is that\nvalues in a static variable have a fixed address in memory. Using the value\nwill always access the same data. Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to\nduplicate their data whenever they\u2019re used. Another difference is that static\nvariables can be mutable. Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is\n_unsafe_. Listing 20-11 shows how to declare, access, and modify a mutable\nstatic variable named `COUNTER`.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Reading from or writing to a mutable static variable is unsafe.\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-11/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAs with regular variables, we specify mutability using the `mut` keyword. Any\ncode that reads or writes from `COUNTER` must be within an `unsafe` block. The\ncode in Listing 20-11 compiles and prints `COUNTER: 3` as we would expect\nbecause it\u2019s single threaded. Having multiple threads access `COUNTER` would\nlikely result in data races, so it is undefined behavior. Therefore, we need to\nmark the entire function as `unsafe` and document the safety limitation so that\nanyone calling the function knows what they are and are not allowed to do\nsafely.\n\nWhenever we write an unsafe function, it is idiomatic to write a comment\nstarting with `SAFETY` and explaining what the caller needs to do to call the\nfunction safely. Likewise, whenever we perform an unsafe operation, it is\nidiomatic to write a comment starting with `SAFETY` to explain how the safety\nrules are upheld.\n\nAdditionally, the compiler will deny by default any attempt to create\nreferences to a mutable static variable through a compiler lint. You must\neither explicitly opt out of that lint\u2019s protections by adding an\n`#[allow(static_mut_refs)]` annotation or access the mutable static variable\nvia a raw pointer created with one of the raw borrow operators. That includes\ncases where the reference is created invisibly, as when it is used in the\n`println!` in this code listing. Requiring references to static mutable\nvariables to be created via raw pointers helps make the safety requirements for\nusing them more obvious.\n\nWith mutable data that is globally accessible, it\u2019s difficult to ensure that\nthere are no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static variables\nto be unsafe. Where possible, it\u2019s preferable to use the concurrency techniques\nand thread-safe smart pointers we discussed in Chapter 16 so that the compiler\nchecks that data access from different threads is done safely.",

One of the best ways to do that is to use Miri,\nan official Rust tool for detecting undefined behavior. Whereas the borrow\nchecker is a _static_ tool that works at compile time, Miri is a _dynamic_\ntool that works at runtime. It checks your code by running your program, or\nits test suite, and detecting when you violate the rules it understands about\nhow Rust should work.\n\nUsing Miri requires a nightly build of Rust (which we talk about more in\n[Appendix G: How Rust is Made and \u201cNightly Rust\u201d][nightly]<!-- ignore -->). You\ncan install both a nightly version of Rust and the Miri tool by typing `rustup\n+nightly component add miri`. This does not change what version of Rust your\nproject uses; it only adds the tool to your system so you can use it when you\nwant to. You can run Miri on a project by typing `cargo +nightly miri run` or\n`cargo +nightly miri test`.\n\nFor an example of how helpful this can be, consider what happens when we run it\nagainst Listing 20-7.\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-07/output.txt}}\n```\n\nMiri correctly warns us that we\u2019re casting an integer to a pointer, which might\nbe a problem, but Miri can\u2019t determine whether a problem exists because it\ndoesn\u2019t know how the pointer originated. Then, Miri returns an error where\nListing 20-7 has undefined behavior because we have a dangling pointer. Thanks\nto Miri, we now know there is a risk of undefined behavior, and we can think\nabout how to make the code safe. In some cases, Miri can even make\nrecommendations about how to fix errors.\n\nMiri doesn\u2019t catch everything you might get wrong when writing unsafe code.\nMiri is a dynamic analysis tool, so it only catches problems with code that\nactually gets run. That means you will need to use it in conjunction with good\ntesting techniques to increase your confidence about the unsafe code you have\nwritten. Miri also does not cover every possible way your code can be unsound.\n\nPut another way: If Miri _does_ catch a problem, you know there\u2019s a bug, but\njust because Miri _doesn\u2019t_ catch a bug doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a problem. It\ncan catch a lot, though. Try running it on the other examples of unsafe code in\nthis chapter and see what it says!\n\nYou can learn more about Miri at [its GitHub repository][miri].\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Defining Traits with Associated Types",
    "content": "_Associated types_ connect a type placeholder with a trait such that the trait\nmethod definitions can use these placeholder types in their signatures. The\nimplementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the\nplaceholder type for the particular implementation. That way, we can define a\ntrait that uses some types without needing to know exactly what those types are\nuntil the trait is implemented.\n\nWe\u2019ve described most of the advanced features in this chapter as being rarely\nneeded. Associated types are somewhere in the middle: They\u2019re used more rarely\nthan features explained in the rest of the book but more commonly than many of\nthe other features discussed in this chapter.\n\nOne example of a trait with an associated type is the `Iterator` trait that the\nstandard library provides. The associated type is named `Item` and stands in\nfor the type of the values the type implementing the `Iterator` trait is\niterating over. The definition of the `Iterator` trait is as shown in Listing\n20-13.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-13\" caption=\"The definition of the `Iterator` trait that has an associated type `Item`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-13/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe type `Item` is a placeholder, and the `next` method\u2019s definition shows that\nit will return values of type `Option<Self::Item>`. Implementors of the\n`Iterator` trait will specify the concrete type for `Item`, and the `next`\nmethod will return an `Option` containing a value of that concrete type.\n\nAssociated types might seem like a similar concept to generics, in that the\nlatter allow us to define a function without specifying what types it can\nhandle. To examine the difference between the two concepts, we\u2019ll look at an\nimplementation of the `Iterator` trait on a type named `Counter` that specifies\nthe `Item` type is `u32`:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-22-iterator-on-counter/src/lib.rs:ch19}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis syntax seems comparable to that of generics. So, why not just define the\n`Iterator` trait with generics, as shown in Listing 20-14?\n\n<Listing number=\"20-14\" caption=\"A hypothetical definition of the `Iterator` trait using generics\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-14/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe difference is that when using generics, as in Listing 20-14, we must\nannotate the types in each implementation; because we can also implement\n`Iterator<String> for Counter` or any other type, we could have multiple\nimplementations of `Iterator` for `Counter`. In other words, when a trait has a\ngeneric parameter, it can be implemented for a type multiple times, changing\nthe concrete types of the generic type parameters each time. When we use the\n`next` method on `Counter`, we would have to provide type annotations to\nindicate which implementation of `Iterator` we want to use.\n\nWith associated types, we don\u2019t need to annotate types, because we can\u2019t\nimplement a trait on a type multiple times. In Listing 20-13 with the\ndefinition that uses associated types, we can choose what the type of `Item`\nwill be only once because there can be only one `impl Iterator for Counter`. We\ndon\u2019t have to specify that we want an iterator of `u32` values everywhere we\ncall `next` on `Counter`.\n\nAssociated types also become part of the trait\u2019s contract: Implementors of the\ntrait must provide a type to stand in for the associated type placeholder.\nAssociated types often have a name that describes how the type will be used,\nand documenting the associated type in the API documentation is a good practice.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "When we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete type for\nthe generic type. This eliminates the need for implementors of the trait to\nspecify a concrete type if the default type works. You specify a default type\nwhen declaring a generic type with the `<PlaceholderType=ConcreteType>` syntax.\n\nA great example of a situation where this technique is useful is with _operator\noverloading_, in which you customize the behavior of an operator (such as `+`)\nin particular situations.\n\nRust doesn\u2019t allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary\noperators. But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed\nin `std::ops` by implementing the traits associated with the operator. For\nexample, in Listing 20-15, we overload the `+` operator to add two `Point`\ninstances together. We do this by implementing the `Add` trait on a `Point`\nstruct.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-15\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `Add` trait to overload the `+` operator for `Point` instances\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-15/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe `add` method adds the `x` values of two `Point` instances and the `y`\nvalues of two `Point` instances to create a new `Point`. The `Add` trait has an\nassociated type named `Output` that determines the type returned from the `add`\nmethod.\n\nThe default generic type in this code is within the `Add` trait. Here is its\ndefinition:\n\n```rust\ntrait Add<Rhs=Self> {\n    type Output;\n\n    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;\n}\n```\n\nThis code should look generally familiar: a trait with one method and an\nassociated type. The new part is `Rhs=Self`: This syntax is called _default\ntype parameters_. The `Rhs` generic type parameter (short for \u201cright-hand\nside\u201d) defines the type of the `rhs` parameter in the `add` method. If we don\u2019t\nspecify a concrete type for `Rhs` when we implement the `Add` trait, the type\nof `Rhs` will default to `Self`, which will be the type we\u2019re implementing\n`Add` on.\n\nWhen we implemented `Add` for `Point`, we used the default for `Rhs` because we\nwanted to add two `Point` instances. Let\u2019s look at an example of implementing\nthe `Add` trait where we want to customize the `Rhs` type rather than using the\ndefault.\n\nWe have two structs, `Millimeters` and `Meters`, holding values in different\nunits. This thin wrapping of an existing type in another struct is known as the\n_newtype pattern_, which we describe in more detail in the [\u201cImplementing\nExternal Traits with the Newtype Pattern\u201d][newtype]<!-- ignore --> section. We\nwant to add values in millimeters to values in meters and have the\nimplementation of `Add` do the conversion correctly. We can implement `Add` for\n`Millimeters` with `Meters` as the `Rhs`, as shown in Listing 20-16.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-16\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `Add` trait on `Millimeters` to add `Millimeters` and `Meters`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-16/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo add `Millimeters` and `Meters`, we specify `impl Add<Meters>` to set the\nvalue of the `Rhs` type parameter instead of using the default of `Self`.\n\nYou\u2019ll use default type parameters in two main ways:\n\n1. To extend a type without breaking existing code\n2. To allow customization in specific cases most users won\u2019t need\n\nThe standard library\u2019s `Add` trait is an example of the second purpose:\nUsually, you\u2019ll add two like types, but the `Add` trait provides the ability to\ncustomize beyond that. Using a default type parameter in the `Add` trait\ndefinition means you don\u2019t have to specify the extra parameter most of the\ntime. In other words, a bit of implementation boilerplate isn\u2019t needed, making\nit easier to use the trait.\n\nThe first purpose is similar to the second but in reverse: If you want to add a\ntype parameter to an existing trait, you can give it a default to allow\nextension of the functionality of the trait without breaking the existing\nimplementation code.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

It\u2019s also possible to implement a method directly on the type with\nthe same name as methods from traits.\n\nWhen calling methods with the same name, you\u2019ll need to tell Rust which one you\nwant to use. Consider the code in Listing 20-17 where we\u2019ve defined two traits,\n`Pilot` and `Wizard`, that both have a method called `fly`. We then implement\nboth traits on a type `Human` that already has a method named `fly` implemented\non it. Each `fly` method does something different.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-17\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Two traits are defined to have a `fly` method and are implemented on the `Human` type, and a `fly` method is implemented on `Human` directly.\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-17/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWhen we call `fly` on an instance of `Human`, the compiler defaults to calling\nthe method that is directly implemented on the type, as shown in Listing 20-18.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-18\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Calling `fly` on an instance of `Human`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-18/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nRunning this code will print `*waving arms furiously*`, showing that Rust\ncalled the `fly` method implemented on `Human` directly.\n\nTo call the `fly` methods from either the `Pilot` trait or the `Wizard` trait,\nwe need to use more explicit syntax to specify which `fly` method we mean.\nListing 20-19 demonstrates this syntax.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-19\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Specifying which trait\u2019s `fly` method we want to call\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-19/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nSpecifying the trait name before the method name clarifies to Rust which\nimplementation of `fly` we want to call. We could also write\n`Human::fly(&person)`, which is equivalent to the `person.fly()` that we used\nin Listing 20-19, but this is a bit longer to write if we don\u2019t need to\ndisambiguate.\n\nRunning this code prints the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-19/output.txt}}\n```\n\nBecause the `fly` method takes a `self` parameter, if we had two _types_ that\nboth implement one _trait_, Rust could figure out which implementation of a\ntrait to use based on the type of `self`.\n\nHowever, associated functions that are not methods don\u2019t have a `self`\nparameter. When there are multiple types or traits that define non-method\nfunctions with the same function name, Rust doesn\u2019t always know which type you\nmean unless you use fully qualified syntax. For example, in Listing 20-20, we\ncreate a trait for an animal shelter that wants to name all baby dogs Spot. We\nmake an `Animal` trait with an associated non-method function `baby_name`. The\n`Animal` trait is implemented for the struct `Dog`, on which we also provide an\nassociated non-method function `baby_name` directly.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-20\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"A trait with an associated function and a type with an associated function of the same name that also implements the trait\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-20/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe implement the code for naming all puppies Spot in the `baby_name` associated\nfunction that is defined on `Dog`. The `Dog` type also implements the trait\n`Animal`, which describes characteristics that all animals have. Baby dogs are\ncalled puppies, and that is expressed in the implementation of the `Animal`\ntrait on `Dog` in the `baby_name` function associated with the `Animal` trait.\n\nIn `main`, we call the `Dog::baby_name` function, which calls the associated\nfunction defined on `Dog` directly. This code prints the following:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-20/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis output isn\u2019t what we wanted. We want to call the `baby_name` function that\nis part of the `Animal` trait that we implemented on `Dog` so that the code\nprints `A baby dog is called a puppy`. The technique of specifying the trait\nname that we used in Listing 20-19 doesn\u2019t help here; if we change `main` to\nthe code in Listing 20-21, we\u2019ll get a compilation error.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-21\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Attempting to call the `baby_name` function from the `Animal` trait, but Rust doesn\u2019t know which implementation to use\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-21/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nBecause `Animal::baby_name` doesn\u2019t have a `self` parameter, and there could be\nother types that implement the `Animal` trait, Rust can\u2019t figure out which\nimplementation of `Animal::baby_name` we want. We\u2019ll get this compiler error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-21/output.txt}}\n```\n\nTo disambiguate and tell Rust that we want to use the implementation of\n`Animal` for `Dog` as opposed to the implementation of `Animal` for some other\ntype, we need to use fully qualified syntax. Listing 20-22 demonstrates how to\nuse fully qualified syntax.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-22\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Using fully qualified syntax to specify that we want to call the `baby_name` function from the `Animal` trait as implemented on `Dog`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-22/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019re providing Rust with a type annotation within the angle brackets, which\nindicates we want to call the `baby_name` method from the `Animal` trait as\nimplemented on `Dog` by saying that we want to treat the `Dog` type as an\n`Animal` for this function call. This code will now print what we want:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-22/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIn general, fully qualified syntax is defined as follows:\n\n```rust,ignore\n<Type as Trait>::function(receiver_if_method, next_arg, ...);\n```\n\nFor associated functions that aren\u2019t methods, there would not be a `receiver`:\nThere would only be the list of other arguments. You could use fully qualified\nsyntax everywhere that you call functions or methods. However, you\u2019re allowed\nto omit any part of this syntax that Rust can figure out from other information\nin the program.

That is, given a `Point` struct that implements the\nstandard library trait `Display` to result in `(x, y)`, when we call\n`outline_print` on a `Point` instance that has `1` for `x` and `3` for `y`, it\nshould print the following:\n\n```text\n**********\n*        *\n* (1, 3) *\n*        *\n**********\n```\n\nIn the implementation of the `outline_print` method, we want to use the\n`Display` trait\u2019s functionality. Therefore, we need to specify that the\n`OutlinePrint` trait will work only for types that also implement `Display` and\nprovide the functionality that `OutlinePrint` needs. We can do that in the\ntrait definition by specifying `OutlinePrint: Display`. This technique is\nsimilar to adding a trait bound to the trait. Listing 20-23 shows an\nimplementation of the `OutlinePrint` trait.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-23\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `OutlinePrint` trait that requires the functionality from `Display`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-23/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nBecause we\u2019ve specified that `OutlinePrint` requires the `Display` trait, we\ncan use the `to_string` function that is automatically implemented for any type\nthat implements `Display`. If we tried to use `to_string` without adding a\ncolon and specifying the `Display` trait after the trait name, we\u2019d get an\nerror saying that no method named `to_string` was found for the type `&Self` in\nthe current scope.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when we try to implement `OutlinePrint` on a type that\ndoesn\u2019t implement `Display`, such as the `Point` struct:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-02-impl-outlineprint-for-point/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe get an error saying that `Display` is required but not implemented:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-02-impl-outlineprint-for-point/output.txt}}\n```\n\nTo fix this, we implement `Display` on `Point` and satisfy the constraint that\n`OutlinePrint` requires, like so:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-03-impl-display-for-point/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThen, implementing the `OutlinePrint` trait on `Point` will compile\nsuccessfully, and we can call `outline_print` on a `Point` instance to display\nit within an outline of asterisks.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "content": "In the [\u201cImplementing a Trait on a Type\u201d][implementing-a-trait-on-a-type]<!--\nignore --> section in Chapter 10, we mentioned the orphan rule that states\nwe\u2019re only allowed to implement a trait on a type if either the trait or the\ntype, or both, are local to our crate. It\u2019s possible to get around this\nrestriction using the newtype pattern, which involves creating a new type in a\ntuple struct. (We covered tuple structs in the [\u201cCreating Different Types with\nTuple Structs\u201d][tuple-structs]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 5.) The tuple\nstruct will have one field and be a thin wrapper around the type for which we\nwant to implement a trait. Then, the wrapper type is local to our crate, and we\ncan implement the trait on the wrapper. _Newtype_ is a term that originates\nfrom the Haskell programming language. There is no runtime performance penalty\nfor using this pattern, and the wrapper type is elided at compile time.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s say we want to implement `Display` on `Vec<T>`, which the\norphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the `Display` trait and the\n`Vec<T>` type are defined outside our crate. We can make a `Wrapper` struct\nthat holds an instance of `Vec<T>`; then, we can implement `Display` on\n`Wrapper` and use the `Vec<T>` value, as shown in Listing 20-24.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-24\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Creating a `Wrapper` type around `Vec<String>` to implement `Display`\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-24/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe implementation of `Display` uses `self.0` to access the inner `Vec<T>`\nbecause `Wrapper` is a tuple struct and `Vec<T>` is the item at index 0 in the\ntuple. Then, we can use the functionality of the `Display` trait on `Wrapper`.\n\nThe downside of using this technique is that `Wrapper` is a new type, so it\ndoesn\u2019t have the methods of the value it\u2019s holding. We would have to implement\nall the methods of `Vec<T>` directly on `Wrapper` such that the methods\ndelegate to `self.0`, which would allow us to treat `Wrapper` exactly like a\n`Vec<T>`. If we wanted the new type to have every method the inner type has,\nimplementing the `Deref` trait on the `Wrapper` to return the inner type would\nbe a solution (we discussed implementing the `Deref` trait in the [\u201cTreating\nSmart Pointers Like Regular References\u201d][smart-pointer-deref]<!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 15). If we didn\u2019t want the `Wrapper` type to have all the\nmethods of the inner type\u2014for example, to restrict the `Wrapper` type\u2019s\nbehavior\u2014we would have to implement just the methods we do want manually.\n\nThis newtype pattern is also useful even when traits are not involved. Let\u2019s\nswitch focus and look at some advanced ways to interact with Rust\u2019s type system.\n\n[newtype]: ch20-02-advanced-traits.html#implementing-external-traits-with-the-newtype-pattern\n[implementing-a-trait-on-a-type]: ch10-02-traits.html#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type\n[traits]: ch10-02-traits.html\n[smart-pointer-deref]: ch15-02-deref.html#treating-smart-pointers-like-regular-references\n[tuple-structs]: ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-different-types-with-tuple-structs",

The newtype pattern\nis also useful for tasks beyond those we\u2019ve discussed so far, including\nstatically enforcing that values are never confused and indicating the units of\na value. You saw an example of using newtypes to indicate units in Listing\n20-16: Recall that the `Millimeters` and `Meters` structs wrapped `u32` values\nin a newtype. If we wrote a function with a parameter of type `Millimeters`, we\nwouldn\u2019t be able to compile a program that accidentally tried to call that\nfunction with a value of type `Meters` or a plain `u32`.\n\nWe can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation\ndetails of a type: The new type can expose a public API that is different from\nthe API of the private inner type.\n\nNewtypes can also hide internal implementation. For example, we could provide a\n`People` type to wrap a `HashMap<i32, String>` that stores a person\u2019s ID\nassociated with their name. Code using `People` would only interact with the\npublic API we provide, such as a method to add a name string to the `People`\ncollection; that code wouldn\u2019t need to know that we assign an `i32` ID to names\ninternally.

    "title": "Type Synonyms and Type Aliases",
    "content": "Rust provides the ability to declare a _type alias_ to give an existing type\nanother name. For this we use the `type` keyword. For example, we can create\nthe alias `Kilometers` to `i32` like so:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-04-kilometers-alias/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nNow the alias `Kilometers` is a _synonym_ for `i32`; unlike the `Millimeters`\nand `Meters` types we created in Listing 20-16, `Kilometers` is not a separate,\nnew type. Values that have the type `Kilometers` will be treated the same as\nvalues of type `i32`:\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-04-kilometers-alias/src/main.rs:there}}\n```\n\nBecause `Kilometers` and `i32` are the same type, we can add values of both\ntypes and can pass `Kilometers` values to functions that take `i32`\nparameters. However, using this method, we don\u2019t get the type-checking benefits\nthat we get from the newtype pattern discussed earlier. In other words, if we\nmix up `Kilometers` and `i32` values somewhere, the compiler will not give us\nan error.\n\nThe main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we\nmight have a lengthy type like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\nBox<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>\n```\n\nWriting this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations all\nover the code can be tiresome and error-prone. Imagine having a project full of\ncode like that in Listing 20-25.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-25\" caption=\"Using a long type in many places\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-25/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nA type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition. In\nListing 20-26, we\u2019ve introduced an alias named `Thunk` for the verbose type and\ncan replace all uses of the type with the shorter alias `Thunk`.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-26\" caption=\"Introducing a type alias, `Thunk`, to reduce repetition\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-26/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code is much easier to read and write! Choosing a meaningful name for a\ntype alias can help communicate your intent as well (_thunk_ is a word for code\nto be evaluated at a later time, so it\u2019s an appropriate name for a closure that\ngets stored).\n\nType aliases are also commonly used with the `Result<T, E>` type for reducing\nrepetition. Consider the `std::io` module in the standard library. I/O\noperations often return a `Result<T, E>` to handle situations when operations\nfail to work. This library has a `std::io::Error` struct that represents all\npossible I/O errors. Many of the functions in `std::io` will be returning\n`Result<T, E>` where the `E` is `std::io::Error`, such as these functions in\nthe `Write` trait:\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-05-write-trait/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nThe `Result<..., Error>` is repeated a lot. As such, `std::io` has this type\nalias declaration:\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-06-result-alias/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nBecause this declaration is in the `std::io` module, we can use the fully\nqualified alias `std::io::Result<T>`; that is, a `Result<T, E>` with the `E`\nfilled in as `std::io::Error`. The `Write` trait function signatures end up\nlooking like this:\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-06-result-alias/src/lib.rs:there}}\n```\n\nThe type alias helps in two ways: It makes code easier to write _and_ it gives\nus a consistent interface across all of `std::io`. Because it\u2019s an alias, it\u2019s\njust another `Result<T, E>`, which means we can use any methods that work on\n`Result<T, E>` with it, as well as special syntax like the `?` operator.",

    "title": "The Never Type That Never Returns",
    "content": "Rust has a special type named `!` that\u2019s known in type theory lingo as the\n_empty type_ because it has no values. We prefer to call it the _never type_\nbecause it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never\nreturn. Here is an example:\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-07-never-type/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThis code is read as \u201cthe function `bar` returns never.\u201d Functions that return\nnever are called _diverging functions_. We can\u2019t create values of the type `!`,\nso `bar` can never possibly return.\n\nBut what use is a type you can never create values for? Recall the code from\nListing 2-5, part of the number-guessing game; we\u2019ve reproduced a bit of it\nhere in Listing 20-27.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-27\" caption=\"A `match` with an arm that ends in `continue`\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-05/src/main.rs:ch19}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAt the time, we skipped over some details in this code. In [\u201cThe `match`\nControl Flow Construct\u201d][the-match-control-flow-construct]<!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 6, we discussed that `match` arms must all return the same\ntype. So, for example, the following code doesn\u2019t work:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-08-match-arms-different-types/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nThe type of `guess` in this code would have to be an integer _and_ a string,\nand Rust requires that `guess` have only one type. So, what does `continue`\nreturn? How were we allowed to return a `u32` from one arm and have another arm\nthat ends with `continue` in Listing 20-27?\n\nAs you might have guessed, `continue` has a `!` value. That is, when Rust\ncomputes the type of `guess`, it looks at both match arms, the former with a\nvalue of `u32` and the latter with a `!` value. Because `!` can never have a\nvalue, Rust decides that the type of `guess` is `u32`.\n\nThe formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type `!` can\nbe coerced into any other type. We\u2019re allowed to end this `match` arm with\n`continue` because `continue` doesn\u2019t return a value; instead, it moves control\nback to the top of the loop, so in the `Err` case, we never assign a value to\n`guess`.\n\nThe never type is useful with the `panic!` macro as well. Recall the `unwrap`\nfunction that we call on `Option<T>` values to produce a value or panic with\nthis definition:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-09-unwrap-definition/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\nIn this code, the same thing happens as in the `match` in Listing 20-27: Rust\nsees that `val` has the type `T` and `panic!` has the type `!`, so the result\nof the overall `match` expression is `T`. This code works because `panic!`\ndoesn\u2019t produce a value; it ends the program. In the `None` case, we won\u2019t be\nreturning a value from `unwrap`, so this code is valid.\n\nOne final expression that has the type `!` is a loop:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-10-loop-returns-never/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nHere, the loop never ends, so `!` is the value of the expression. However, this\nwouldn\u2019t be true if we included a `break`, because the loop would terminate\nwhen it got to the `break`.",

    "title": "Dynamically Sized Types and the `Sized` Trait",
    "content": "Rust needs to know certain details about its types, such as how much space to\nallocate for a value of a particular type. This leaves one corner of its type\nsystem a little confusing at first: the concept of _dynamically sized types_.\nSometimes referred to as _DSTs_ or _unsized types_, these types let us write\ncode using values whose size we can know only at runtime.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the details of a dynamically sized type called `str`, which\nwe\u2019ve been using throughout the book. That\u2019s right, not `&str`, but `str` on\nits own, is a DST. In many cases, such as when storing text entered by a user,\nwe can\u2019t know how long the string is until runtime. That means we can\u2019t create\na variable of type `str`, nor can we take an argument of type `str`. Consider\nthe following code, which does not work:\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-11-cant-create-str/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\nRust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any value of a particular\ntype, and all values of a type must use the same amount of memory. If Rust\nallowed us to write this code, these two `str` values would need to take up the\nsame amount of space. But they have different lengths: `s1` needs 12 bytes of\nstorage and `s2` needs 15. This is why it\u2019s not possible to create a variable\nholding a dynamically sized type.\n\nSo, what do we do? In this case, you already know the answer: We make the type\nof `s1` and `s2` string slice (`&str`) rather than `str`. Recall from the\n[\u201cString Slices\u201d][string-slices]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 that the\nslice data structure only stores the starting position and the length of the\nslice. So, although `&T` is a single value that stores the memory address of\nwhere the `T` is located, a string slice is _two_ values: the address of the\n`str` and its length. As such, we can know the size of a string slice value at\ncompile time: It\u2019s twice the length of a `usize`. That is, we always know the\nsize of a string slice, no matter how long the string it refers to is. In\ngeneral, this is the way in which dynamically sized types are used in Rust:\nThey have an extra bit of metadata that stores the size of the dynamic\ninformation. The golden rule of dynamically sized types is that we must always\nput values of dynamically sized types behind a pointer of some kind.\n\nWe can combine `str` with all kinds of pointers: for example, `Box<str>` or\n`Rc<str>`. In fact, you\u2019ve seen this before but with a different dynamically\nsized type: traits. Every trait is a dynamically sized type we can refer to by\nusing the name of the trait. In the [\u201cUsing Trait Objects to Abstract over\nShared Behavior\u201d][using-trait-objects-to-abstract-over-shared-behavior]<!--\nignore --> section in Chapter 18, we mentioned that to use traits as trait\nobjects, we must put them behind a pointer, such as `&dyn Trait` or `Box<dyn\nTrait>` (`Rc<dyn Trait>` would work too).\n\nTo work with DSTs, Rust provides the `Sized` trait to determine whether or not\na type\u2019s size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented\nfor everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust\nimplicitly adds a bound on `Sized` to every generic function. That is, a\ngeneric function definition like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-12-generic-fn-definition/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nis actually treated as though we had written this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-13-generic-implicit-sized-bound/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nBy default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known size at\ncompile time. However, you can use the following special syntax to relax this\nrestriction:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-14-generic-maybe-sized/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\nA trait bound on `?Sized` means \u201c`T` may or may not be `Sized`,\u201d and this\nnotation overrides the default that generic types must have a known size at\ncompile time. The `?Trait` syntax with this meaning is only available for\n`Sized`, not any other traits.\n\nAlso note that we switched the type of the `t` parameter from `T` to `&T`.\nBecause the type might not be `Sized`, we need to use it behind some kind of\npointer. In this case, we\u2019ve chosen a reference.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll talk about functions and closures!\n\n[encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details]: ch18-01-what-is-oo.html#encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details\n[string-slices]: ch04-03-slices.html#string-slices\n[the-match-control-flow-construct]: ch06-02-match.html#the-match-control-flow-construct\n[using-trait-objects-to-abstract-over-shared-behavior]: ch18-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-to-abstract-over-shared-behavior\n[newtype]: ch20-02-advanced-traits.html#implementing-external-traits-with-the-newtype-pattern",

Passing\nfunctions with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments\nto other functions.\n\nThe syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is similar to\nthat of closures, as shown in Listing 20-28, where we\u2019ve defined a function\n`add_one` that adds 1 to its parameter.

In `main`, we can pass\nthe function name `add_one` as the first argument to `do_twice`.\n\nUnlike closures, `fn` is a type rather than a trait, so we specify `fn` as the\nparameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one\nof the `Fn` traits as a trait bound.\n\nFunction pointers implement all three of the closure traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, and\n`FnOnce`), meaning you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a\nfunction that expects a closure. It\u2019s best to write functions using a generic\ntype and one of the closure traits so that your functions can accept either\nfunctions or closures.\n\nThat said, one example of where you would want to only accept `fn` and not\nclosures is when interfacing with external code that doesn\u2019t have closures: C\nfunctions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn\u2019t have closures.\n\nAs an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or a named\nfunction, let\u2019s look at a use of the `map` method provided by the `Iterator`\ntrait in the standard library. To use the `map` method to turn a vector of\nnumbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, as in Listing 20-29.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-29\" caption=\"Using a closure with the `map` method to convert numbers to strings\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-29/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nOr we could name a function as the argument to `map` instead of the closure.\nListing 20-30 shows what this would look like.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-30\" caption=\"Using the `String::to_string` function with the `map` method to convert numbers to strings\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-30/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNote that we must use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about in the\n[\u201cAdvanced Traits\u201d][advanced-traits]<!-- ignore --> section because there are\nmultiple functions available named `to_string`.\n\nHere, we\u2019re using the `to_string` function defined in the `ToString` trait,\nwhich the standard library has implemented for any type that implements\n`Display`.\n\nRecall from the [\u201cEnum Values\u201d][enum-values]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter\n6 that the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes an initializer\nfunction. We can use these initializer functions as function pointers that\nimplement the closure traits, which means we can specify the initializer\nfunctions as arguments for methods that take closures, as seen in Listing 20-31.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-31\" caption=\"Using an enum initializer with the `map` method to create a `Status` instance from numbers\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-31/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we create `Status::Value` instances using each `u32` value in the range\nthat `map` is called on by using the initializer function of `Status::Value`.\nSome people prefer this style and some people prefer to use closures. They\ncompile to the same code, so use whichever style is clearer to you.",

    "content": "Closures are represented by traits, which means you can\u2019t return closures\ndirectly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead\nuse the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the\nfunction. However, you can\u2019t usually do that with closures because they don\u2019t\nhave a concrete type that is returnable; you\u2019re not allowed to use the function\npointer `fn` as a return type if the closure captures any values from its\nscope, for example.\n\nInstead, you will normally use the `impl Trait` syntax we learned about in\nChapter 10. You can return any function type, using `Fn`, `FnOnce`, and `FnMut`.\nFor example, the code in Listing 20-32 will compile just fine.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-32\" caption=\"Returning a closure from a function using the `impl Trait` syntax\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-32/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHowever, as we noted in the [\u201cInferring and Annotating Closure\nTypes\u201d][closure-types]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 13, each closure is\nalso its own distinct type. If you need to work with multiple functions that\nhave the same signature but different implementations, you will need to use a\ntrait object for them. Consider what happens if you write code like that shown\nin Listing 20-33.\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\" number=\"20-33\" caption=\"Creating a `Vec<T>` of closures defined by functions that return `impl Fn` types\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-33/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere we have two functions, `returns_closure` and `returns_initialized_closure`,\nwhich both return `impl Fn(i32) -> i32`. Notice that the closures that they\nreturn are different, even though they implement the same type. If we try to\ncompile this, Rust lets us know that it won\u2019t work:\n\n```text\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-33/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error message tells us that whenever we return an `impl Trait`, Rust\ncreates a unique _opaque type_, a type where we cannot see into the details of\nwhat Rust constructs for us, nor can we guess the type Rust will generate to\nwrite ourselves. So, even though these functions return closures that implement\nthe same trait, `Fn(i32) -> i32`, the opaque types Rust generates for each are\ndistinct. (This is similar to how Rust produces different concrete types for\ndistinct async blocks even when they have the same output type, as we saw in\n[\u201cThe `Pin` Type and the `Unpin` Trait\u201d][future-types]<!-- ignore --> in\nChapter 17.) We have seen a solution to this problem a few times now: We can\nuse a trait object, as in Listing 20-34.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-34\" caption=\"Creating a `Vec<T>` of closures defined by functions that return `Box<dyn Fn>` so that they have the same type\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-34/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will compile just fine.

    "content": "Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which\nis known as _metaprogramming_. In Appendix C, we discuss the `derive`\nattribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for you. We\u2019ve\nalso used the `println!` and `vec!` macros throughout the book. All of these\nmacros _expand_ to produce more code than the code you\u2019ve written manually.\n\nMetaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and\nmaintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have\nsome additional powers that functions don\u2019t have.\n\nA function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the\nfunction has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of\nparameters: We can call `println!(\"hello\")` with one argument or\n`println!(\"hello {}\", name)` with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded\nbefore the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for\nexample, implement a trait on a given type. A function can\u2019t, because it gets\ncalled at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.\n\nThe downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro\ndefinitions are more complex than function definitions because you\u2019re writing\nRust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are\ngenerally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function\ndefinitions.\n\nAnother important difference between macros and functions is that you must\ndefine macros or bring them into scope _before_ you call them in a file, as\nopposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

    "title": "Declarative Macros for General Metaprogramming",
    "content": "The most widely used form of macros in Rust is the _declarative macro_. These\nare also sometimes referred to as \u201cmacros by example,\u201d \u201c`macro_rules!` macros,\u201d\nor just plain \u201cmacros.\u201d At their core, declarative macros allow you to write\nsomething similar to a Rust `match` expression. As discussed in Chapter 6,\n`match` expressions are control structures that take an expression, compare the\nresultant value of the expression to patterns, and then run the code associated\nwith the matching pattern. Macros also compare a value to patterns that are\nassociated with particular code: In this situation, the value is the literal\nRust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared with the\nstructure of that source code; and the code associated with each pattern, when\nmatched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during\ncompilation.\n\nTo define a macro, you use the `macro_rules!` construct. Let\u2019s explore how to\nuse `macro_rules!` by looking at how the `vec!` macro is defined. Chapter 8\ncovered how we can use the `vec!` macro to create a new vector with particular\nvalues. For example, the following macro creates a new vector containing three\nintegers:\n\n```rust\nlet v: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];\n```\n\nWe could also use the `vec!` macro to make a vector of two integers or a vector\nof five string slices. We wouldn\u2019t be able to use a function to do the same\nbecause we wouldn\u2019t know the number or type of values up front.\n\nListing 20-35 shows a slightly simplified definition of the `vec!` macro.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-35\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"A simplified version of the `vec!` macro definition\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-35/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\n> Note: The actual definition of the `vec!` macro in the standard library\n> includes code to pre-allocate the correct amount of memory up front. That code\n> is an optimization that we don\u2019t include here, to make the example simpler.\n\nThe `#[macro_export]` annotation indicates that this macro should be made\navailable whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is brought into\nscope. Without this annotation, the macro can\u2019t be brought into scope.\n\nWe then start the macro definition with `macro_rules!` and the name of the\nmacro we\u2019re defining _without_ the exclamation mark. The name, in this case\n`vec`, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.\n\nThe structure in the `vec!` body is similar to the structure of a `match`\nexpression. Here we have one arm with the pattern `( $( $x:expr ),* )`,\nfollowed by `=>` and the block of code associated with this pattern. If the\npattern matches, the associated block of code will be emitted. Given that this\nis the only pattern in this macro, there is only one valid way to match; any\nother pattern will result in an error. More complex macros will have more than\none arm.\n\nValid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different from the pattern syntax\ncovered in Chapter 19 because macro patterns are matched against Rust code\nstructure rather than values. Let\u2019s walk through what the pattern pieces in\nListing 20-29 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see the [Rust\nReference][ref].\n\nFirst, we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern. We use a\ndollar sign (`$`) to declare a variable in the macro system that will contain\nthe Rust code matching the pattern. The dollar sign makes it clear this is a\nmacro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable. Next comes a set of\nparentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses\nfor use in the replacement code. Within `$()` is `$x:expr`, which matches any\nRust expression and gives the expression the name `$x`.\n\nThe comma following `$()` indicates that a literal comma separator character\nmust appear between each instance of the code that matches the code in `$()`.\nThe `*` specifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes\nthe `*`.\n\nWhen we call this macro with `vec![1, 2, 3];`, the `$x` pattern matches three\ntimes with the three expressions `1`, `2`, and `3`.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with this arm:\n`temp_vec.push()` within `$()*` is generated for each part that matches `$()`\nin the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern\nmatches. The `$x` is replaced with each expression matched. When we call this\nmacro with `vec![1, 2, 3];`, the code generated that replaces this macro call\nwill be the following:\n\n```rust,ignore\n{\n    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();\n    temp_vec.push(1);\n    temp_vec.push(2);\n    temp_vec.push(3);\n    temp_vec\n}\n```\n\nWe\u2019ve defined a macro that can take any number of arguments of any type and can\ngenerate code to create a vector containing the specified elements.\n\nTo learn more about how to write macros, consult the online documentation or\nother resources, such as [\u201cThe Little Book of Rust Macros\u201d][tlborm] started by\nDaniel Keep and continued by Lukas Wirth.",

The three kinds of procedural macros are custom `derive`,\nattribute-like, and function-like, and all work in a similar fashion.\n\nWhen creating procedural macros, the definitions must reside in their own crate\nwith a special crate type. This is for complex technical reasons that we hope\nto eliminate in the future. In Listing 20-36, we show how to define a\nprocedural macro, where `some_attribute` is a placeholder for using a specific\nmacro variety.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-36\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An example of defining a procedural macro\">\n\n```rust,ignore\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[some_attribute]\npub fn some_name(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe function that defines a procedural macro takes a `TokenStream` as an input\nand produces a `TokenStream` as an output. The `TokenStream` type is defined by\nthe `proc_macro` crate that is included with Rust and represents a sequence of\ntokens. This is the core of the macro: The source code that the macro is\noperating on makes up the input `TokenStream`, and the code the macro produces\nis the output `TokenStream`. The function also has an attribute attached to it\nthat specifies which kind of procedural macro we\u2019re creating. We can have\nmultiple kinds of procedural macros in the same crate.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the different kinds of procedural macros.

    "content": "Let\u2019s create a crate named `hello_macro` that defines a trait named\n`HelloMacro` with one associated function named `hello_macro`. Rather than\nmaking our users implement the `HelloMacro` trait for each of their types,\nwe\u2019ll provide a procedural macro so that users can annotate their type with\n`#[derive(HelloMacro)]` to get a default implementation of the `hello_macro`\nfunction. The default implementation will print `Hello, Macro! My name is\nTypeName!` where `TypeName` is the name of the type on which this trait has\nbeen defined. In other words, we\u2019ll write a crate that enables another\nprogrammer to write code like Listing 20-37 using our crate.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-37\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"The code a user of our crate will be able to write when using our procedural macro\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-37/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code will print `Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!` when we\u2019re done. The\nfirst step is to make a new library crate, like this:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new hello_macro --lib\n```\n\nNext, in Listing 20-38, we\u2019ll define the `HelloMacro` trait and its associated\nfunction.\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" number=\"20-38\" caption=\"A simple trait that we will use with the `derive` macro\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-38/hello_macro/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe have a trait and its function. At this point, our crate user could implement\nthe trait to achieve the desired functionality, as in Listing 20-39.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-39\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"How it would look if users wrote a manual implementation of the `HelloMacro` trait\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-39/pancakes/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHowever, they would need to write the implementation block for each type they\nwanted to use with `hello_macro`; we want to spare them from having to do this\nwork.\n\nAdditionally, we can\u2019t yet provide the `hello_macro` function with default\nimplementation that will print the name of the type the trait is implemented\non: Rust doesn\u2019t have reflection capabilities, so it can\u2019t look up the type\u2019s\nname at runtime. We need a macro to generate code at compile time.\n\nThe next step is to define the procedural macro. At the time of this writing,\nprocedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction\nmight be lifted. The convention for structuring crates and macro crates is as\nfollows: For a crate named `foo`, a custom `derive` procedural macro crate is\ncalled `foo_derive`. Let\u2019s start a new crate called `hello_macro_derive` inside\nour `hello_macro` project:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib\n```\n\nOur two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro crate\nwithin the directory of our `hello_macro` crate. If we change the trait\ndefinition in `hello_macro`, we\u2019ll have to change the implementation of the\nprocedural macro in `hello_macro_derive` as well. The two crates will need to\nbe published separately, and programmers using these crates will need to add\nboth as dependencies and bring them both into scope. We could instead have the\n`hello_macro` crate use `hello_macro_derive` as a dependency and re-export the\nprocedural macro code. However, the way we\u2019ve structured the project makes it\npossible for programmers to use `hello_macro` even if they don\u2019t want the\n`derive` functionality.\n\nWe need to declare the `hello_macro_derive` crate as a procedural macro crate.\nWe\u2019ll also need functionality from the `syn` and `quote` crates, as you\u2019ll see\nin a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the following to the\n_Cargo.toml_ file for `hello_macro_derive`:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"hello_macro_derive/Cargo.toml\">\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-40/hello_macro/hello_macro_derive/Cargo.toml:6:12}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing 20-40 into\nyour _src/lib.rs_ file for the `hello_macro_derive` crate. Note that this code\nwon\u2019t compile until we add a definition for the `impl_hello_macro` function.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-40\" file-name=\"hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Code that most procedural macro crates will require in order to process Rust code\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-40/hello_macro/hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nNotice that we\u2019ve split the code into the `hello_macro_derive` function, which\nis responsible for parsing the `TokenStream`, and the `impl_hello_macro`\nfunction, which is responsible for transforming the syntax tree: This makes\nwriting a procedural macro more convenient. The code in the outer function\n(`hello_macro_derive` in this case) will be the same for almost every\nprocedural macro crate you see or create. The code you specify in the body of\nthe inner function (`impl_hello_macro` in this case) will be different\ndepending on your procedural macro\u2019s purpose.\n\nWe\u2019ve introduced three new crates: `proc_macro`, [`syn`][syn]<!-- ignore -->,\nand [`quote`][quote]<!-- ignore -->. The `proc_macro` crate comes with Rust,\nso we didn\u2019t need to add that to the dependencies in _Cargo.toml_. The\n`proc_macro` crate is the compiler\u2019s API that allows us to read and manipulate\nRust code from our code.\n\nThe `syn` crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure that we\ncan perform operations on. The `quote` crate turns `syn` data structures back\ninto Rust code. These crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust\ncode we might want to handle: Writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple\ntask.\n\nThe `hello_macro_derive` function will be called when a user of our library\nspecifies `#[derive(HelloMacro)]` on a type. This is possible because we\u2019ve\nannotated the `hello_macro_derive` function here with `proc_macro_derive` and\nspecified the name `HelloMacro`, which matches our trait name; this is the\nconvention most procedural macros follow.\n\nThe `hello_macro_derive` function first converts the `input` from a\n`TokenStream` to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform\noperations on. This is where `syn` comes into play. The `parse` function in\n`syn` takes a `TokenStream` and returns a `DeriveInput` struct representing the\nparsed Rust code. Listing 20-41 shows the relevant parts of the `DeriveInput`\nstruct we get from parsing the `struct Pancakes;` string.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-41\" caption=\"The `DeriveInput` instance we get when parsing the code that has the macro\u2019s attribute in Listing 20-37\">\n\n```rust,ignore\nDeriveInput {\n    // --snip--\n\n    ident: Ident {\n        ident: \"Pancakes\",\n        span: #0 bytes(95..103)\n    },\n    data: Struct(\n        DataStruct {\n            struct_token: Struct,\n            fields: Unit,\n            semi_token: Some(\n                Semi\n            )\n        }\n    )\n}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThe fields of this struct show that the Rust code we\u2019ve parsed is a unit struct\nwith the `ident` (_identifier_, meaning the name) of `Pancakes`. There are more\nfields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the [`syn`\ndocumentation for `DeriveInput`][syn-docs] for more information.\n\nSoon we\u2019ll define the `impl_hello_macro` function, which is where we\u2019ll build\nthe new Rust code we want to include. But before we do, note that the output\nfor our `derive` macro is also a `TokenStream`. The returned `TokenStream` is\nadded to the code that our crate users write, so when they compile their crate,\nthey\u2019ll get the extra functionality that we provide in the modified\n`TokenStream`.\n\nYou might have noticed that we\u2019re calling `unwrap` to cause the\n`hello_macro_derive` function to panic if the call to the `syn::parse` function\nfails here. It\u2019s necessary for our procedural macro to panic on errors because\n`proc_macro_derive` functions must return `TokenStream` rather than `Result` to\nconform to the procedural macro API. We\u2019ve simplified this example by using\n`unwrap`; in production code, you should provide more specific error messages\nabout what went wrong by using `panic!` or `expect`.\n\nNow that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a `TokenStream`\ninto a `DeriveInput` instance, let\u2019s generate the code that implements the\n`HelloMacro` trait on the annotated type, as shown in Listing 20-42.\n\n<Listing number=\"20-42\" file-name=\"hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing the `HelloMacro` trait using the parsed Rust code\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/listing-20-42/hello_macro/hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe get an `Ident` struct instance containing the name (identifier) of the\nannotated type using `ast.ident`. The struct in Listing 20-41 shows that when\nwe run the `impl_hello_macro` function on the code in Listing 20-37, the\n`ident` we get will have the `ident` field with a value of `\"Pancakes\"`. Thus,\nthe `name` variable in Listing 20-42 will contain an `Ident` struct instance\nthat, when printed, will be the string `\"Pancakes\"`, the name of the struct in\nListing 20-37.\n\nThe `quote!` macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return. The\ncompiler expects something different from the direct result of the `quote!`\nmacro\u2019s execution, so we need to convert it to a `TokenStream`. We do this by\ncalling the `into` method, which consumes this intermediate representation and\nreturns a value of the required `TokenStream` type.\n\nThe `quote!` macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: We can\nenter `#name`, and `quote!` will replace it with the value in the variable\n`name`. You can even do some repetition similar to the way regular macros work.\nCheck out [the `quote` crate\u2019s docs][quote-docs] for a thorough introduction.\n\nWe want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our `HelloMacro`\ntrait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by using `#name`. The\ntrait implementation has the one function `hello_macro`, whose body contains the\nfunctionality we want to provide: printing `Hello, Macro! My name is` and then\nthe name of the annotated type.\n\nThe `stringify!` macro used here is built into Rust. It takes a Rust\nexpression, such as `1 + 2`, and at compile time turns the expression into a\nstring literal, such as `\"1 + 2\"`. This is different from `format!` or\n`println!`, which are macros that evaluate the expression and then turn the\nresult into a `String`. There is a possibility that the `#name` input might be\nan expression to print literally, so we use `stringify!`. Using `stringify!`\nalso saves an allocation by converting `#name` to a string literal at compile\ntime.\n\nAt this point, `cargo build` should complete successfully in both `hello_macro`\nand `hello_macro_derive`. Let\u2019s hook up these crates to the code in Listing\n20-37 to see the procedural macro in action! Create a new binary project in\nyour _projects_ directory using `cargo new pancakes`. We need to add\n`hello_macro` and `hello_macro_derive` as dependencies in the `pancakes`\ncrate\u2019s _Cargo.toml_. If you\u2019re publishing your versions of `hello_macro` and\n`hello_macro_derive` to [crates.io](https://crates.io/)<!-- ignore -->, they\nwould be regular dependencies; if not, you can specify them as `path`\ndependencies as follows:\n\n```toml\n{{#include ../listings/ch20-advanced-features/no-listing-21-pancakes/pancakes/Cargo.toml:6:8}}\n```\n\nPut the code in Listing 20-37 into _src/main.rs_, and run `cargo run`: It\nshould print `Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!`. The implementation of the\n`HelloMacro` trait from the procedural macro was included without the\n`pancakes` crate needing to implement it; the `#[derive(HelloMacro)]` added the\ntrait implementation.\n\nNext, let\u2019s explore how the other kinds of procedural macros differ from custom\n`derive` macros.",

Say you have an attribute\nnamed `route` that annotates functions when using a web application framework:\n\n```rust,ignore\n#[route(GET, \"/\")]\nfn index() {\n```\n\nThis `#[route]` attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural\nmacro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:\n\n```rust,ignore\n#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n```\n\nHere, we have two parameters of type `TokenStream`.

In this\nchapter, we\u2019ll build one more project together to demonstrate some of the\nconcepts we covered in the final chapters, as well as recap some earlier\nlessons.\n\nFor our final project, we\u2019ll make a web server that says \u201cHello!\u201d and looks like\nFigure 21-1 in a web browser.\n\nHere is our plan for building the web server:\n\n1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.\n2. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.\n3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.\n4. Create a proper HTTP response.\n5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.\n\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of a web browser visiting the address 127.0.0.1:8080 displaying a webpage with the text content \u201cHello! Hi from Rust\u201d\" src=\"img/trpl21-01.png\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\" />\n\n<span class=\"caption\">Figure 21-1: Our final shared project</span>\n\nBefore we get started, we should mention two details. First, the method we\u2019ll\nuse won\u2019t be the best way to build a web server with Rust. Community members\nhave published a number of production-ready crates available at\n[crates.io](https://crates.io/) that provide more complete web server and\nthread pool implementations than we\u2019ll build. However, our intention in this\nchapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy route. Because Rust is a\nsystems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want to\nwork with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in other\nlanguages.\n\nSecond, we will not be using async and await here. Building a thread pool is a\nbig enough challenge on its own, without adding in building an async runtime!\nHowever, we will note how async and await might be applicable to some of the\nsame problems we will see in this chapter. Ultimately, as we noted back in\nChapter 17, many async runtimes use thread pools for managing their work.\n\nWe\u2019ll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so that\nyou can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might use\nin the future.",

Before we begin,\nlet\u2019s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web\nservers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but\na brief overview will give you the information you need.\n\nThe two main protocols involved in web servers are _Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol_ _(HTTP)_ and _Transmission Control Protocol_ _(TCP)_. Both protocols\nare _request-response_ protocols, meaning a _client_ initiates requests and a\n_server_ listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The\ncontents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.\n\nTCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information\ngets from one server to another but doesn\u2019t specify what that information is.\nHTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and\nresponses. It\u2019s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in\nthe vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We\u2019ll work with the\nraw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.",

    "title": "Listening to the TCP Connection",
    "content": "Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that\u2019s the first part\nwe\u2019ll work on. The standard library offers a `std::net` module that lets us do\nthis. Let\u2019s make a new project in the usual fashion:\n\n```console\n$ cargo new hello\n     Created binary (application) `hello` project\n$ cd hello\n```\n\nNow enter the code in Listing 21-1 in _src/main.rs_ to start. This code will\nlisten at the local address `127.0.0.1:7878` for incoming TCP streams. When it\ngets an incoming stream, it will print `Connection established!`.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-1\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Listening for incoming streams and printing a message when we receive a stream\">\n\n```rust,no_run\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-01/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nUsing `TcpListener`, we can listen for TCP connections at the address\n`127.0.0.1:7878`. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address\nrepresenting your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn\u2019t\nrepresent the authors\u2019 computer specifically), and `7878` is the port. We\u2019ve\nchosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn\u2019t normally accepted on this port, so\nour server is unlikely to conflict with any other web server you might have\nrunning on your machine, and 7878 is _rust_ typed on a telephone.\n\nThe `bind` function in this scenario works like the `new` function in that it\nwill return a new `TcpListener` instance. The function is called `bind`\nbecause, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as \u201cbinding\nto a port.\u201d\n\nThe `bind` function returns a `Result<T, E>`, which indicates that it\u2019s\npossible for binding to fail, for example, if we ran two instances of our\nprogram and so had two programs listening to the same port. Because we\u2019re\nwriting a basic server just for learning purposes, we won\u2019t worry about\nhandling these kinds of errors; instead, we use `unwrap` to stop the program if\nerrors happen.\n\nThe `incoming` method on `TcpListener` returns an iterator that gives us a\nsequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type `TcpStream`). A single\n_stream_ represents an open connection between the client and the server.\n_Connection_ is the name for the full request and response process in which a\nclient connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server\ncloses the connection. As such, we will read from the `TcpStream` to see what\nthe client sent and then write our response to the stream to send data back to\nthe client. Overall, this `for` loop will process each connection in turn and\nproduce a series of streams for us to handle.\n\nFor now, our handling of the stream consists of calling `unwrap` to terminate\nour program if the stream has any errors; if there aren\u2019t any errors, the\nprogram prints a message. We\u2019ll add more functionality for the success case in\nthe next listing. The reason we might receive errors from the `incoming` method\nwhen a client connects to the server is that we\u2019re not actually iterating over\nconnections. Instead, we\u2019re iterating over _connection attempts_. The\nconnection might not be successful for a number of reasons, many of them\noperating system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to\nthe number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection\nattempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open\nconnections are closed.\n\nLet\u2019s try running this code! Invoke `cargo run` in the terminal and then load\n_127.0.0.1:7878_ in a web browser. The browser should show an error message\nlike \u201cConnection reset\u201d because the server isn\u2019t currently sending back any\ndata. But when you look at your terminal, you should see several messages that\nwere printed when the browser connected to the server!\n\n```text\n     Running `target/debug/hello`\nConnection established!\nConnection established!\nConnection established!\n```\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the\nreason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a\nrequest for other resources, like the _favicon.ico_ icon that appears in the\nbrowser tab.\n\nIt could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server multiple\ntimes because the server isn\u2019t responding with any data. When `stream` goes out\nof scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as\npart of the `drop` implementation. Browsers sometimes deal with closed\nconnections by retrying, because the problem might be temporary.\n\nBrowsers also sometimes open multiple connections to the server without sending\nany requests so that if they *do* later send requests, those requests can\nhappen more quickly. When this occurs, our server will see each connection,\nregardless of whether there are any requests over that connection. Many\nversions of Chrome-based browsers do this, for example; you can disable that\noptimization by using private browsing mode or using a different browser.\n\nThe important factor is that we\u2019ve successfully gotten a handle to a TCP\nconnection!\n\nRemember to stop the program by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> when\nyou\u2019re done running a particular version of the code. Then, restart the program\nby invoking the `cargo run` command after you\u2019ve made each set of code changes\nto make sure you\u2019re running the newest code.",

    "content": "Let\u2019s implement the functionality to read the request from the browser! To\nseparate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking some action\nwith the connection, we\u2019ll start a new function for processing connections. In\nthis new `handle_connection` function, we\u2019ll read data from the TCP stream and\nprint it so that we can see the data being sent from the browser. Change the\ncode to look like Listing 21-2.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-2\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Reading from the `TcpStream` and printing the data\">\n\n```rust,no_run\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-02/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe bring `std::io::BufReader` and `std::io::prelude` into scope to get access\nto traits and types that let us read from and write to the stream. In the `for`\nloop in the `main` function, instead of printing a message that says we made a\nconnection, we now call the new `handle_connection` function and pass the\n`stream` to it.\n\nIn the `handle_connection` function, we create a new `BufReader` instance that\nwraps a reference to the `stream`. The `BufReader` adds buffering by managing\ncalls to the `std::io::Read` trait methods for us.\n\nWe create a variable named `http_request` to collect the lines of the request\nthe browser sends to our server. We indicate that we want to collect these\nlines in a vector by adding the `Vec<_>` type annotation.\n\n`BufReader` implements the `std::io::BufRead` trait, which provides the `lines`\nmethod. The `lines` method returns an iterator of `Result<String,\nstd::io::Error>` by splitting the stream of data whenever it sees a newline\nbyte. To get each `String`, we `map` and `unwrap` each `Result`. The `Result`\nmight be an error if the data isn\u2019t valid UTF-8 or if there was a problem\nreading from the stream. Again, a production program should handle these errors\nmore gracefully, but we\u2019re choosing to stop the program in the error case for\nsimplicity.\n\nThe browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline\ncharacters in a row, so to get one request from the stream, we take lines until\nwe get a line that is the empty string. Once we\u2019ve collected the lines into the\nvector, we\u2019re printing them out using pretty debug formatting so that we can\ntake a look at the instructions the web browser is sending to our server.\n\nLet\u2019s try this code! Start the program and make a request in a web browser\nagain. Note that we\u2019ll still get an error page in the browser, but our\nprogram\u2019s output in the terminal will now look similar to this:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-02\ncargo run\nmake a request to 127.0.0.1:7878\nCan't automate because the output depends on making requests\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s\n     Running `target/debug/hello`\nRequest: [\n    \"GET / HTTP/1.1\",\n    \"Host: 127.0.0.1:7878\",\n    \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0\",\n    \"Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\",\n    \"Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\",\n    \"Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\",\n    \"DNT: 1\",\n    \"Connection: keep-alive\",\n    \"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Dest: document\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Site: none\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-User: ?1\",\n    \"Cache-Control: max-age=0\",\n]\n```\n\nDepending on your browser, you might get slightly different output. Now that\nwe\u2019re printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple connections\nfrom one browser request by looking at the path after `GET` in the first line\nof the request. If the repeated connections are all requesting _/_, we know the\nbrowser is trying to fetch _/_ repeatedly because it\u2019s not getting a response\nfrom our program.\n\nLet\u2019s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of\nour program.\n\n<!-- Old headings.

After the\nCRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the\nresponse.\n\nHere is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1 and has a status code of\n200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:\n\n```text\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n\\r\\n\n```\n\nThe status code 200 is the standard success response. The text is a tiny\nsuccessful HTTP response. Let\u2019s write this to the stream as our response to a\nsuccessful request!

Because the `write_all`\noperation could fail, we use `unwrap` on any error result as before.

Listing 21-10 implements handling a request\nto _/sleep_ with a simulated slow response that will cause the server to sleep\nfor five seconds before responding.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-10\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Simulating a slow request by sleeping for five seconds\">\n\n```rust,no_run\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-10/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe switched from `if` to `match` now that we have three cases. We need to\nexplicitly match on a slice of `request_line` to pattern-match against the\nstring literal values; `match` doesn\u2019t do automatic referencing and\ndereferencing, like the equality method does.\n\nThe first arm is the same as the `if` block from Listing 21-9. The second arm\nmatches a request to _/sleep_. When that request is received, the server will\nsleep for five seconds before rendering the successful HTML page. The third arm\nis the same as the `else` block from Listing 21-9.\n\nYou can see how primitive our server is: Real libraries would handle the\nrecognition of multiple requests in a much less verbose way!\n\nStart the server using `cargo run`. Then, open two browser windows: one for\n_http://127.0.0.1:7878_ and the other for _http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep_. If you\nenter the _/_ URI a few times, as before, you\u2019ll see it respond quickly. But if\nyou enter _/sleep_ and then load _/_, you\u2019ll see that _/_ waits until `sleep`\nhas slept for its full five seconds before loading.\n\nThere are multiple techniques we could use to avoid requests backing up behind\na slow request, including using async as we did Chapter 17; the one we\u2019ll\nimplement is a thread pool.",

    "title": "Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool",
    "content": "A _thread pool_ is a group of spawned threads that are ready and waiting to\nhandle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the\nthreads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The\nremaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come\nin while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done\nprocessing its task, it\u2019s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle\na new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,\nincreasing the throughput of your server.\n\nWe\u2019ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to protect us\nfrom DoS attacks; if we had our program create a new thread for each request as\nit came in, someone making 10 million requests to our server could wreak havoc\nby using up all our server\u2019s resources and grinding the processing of requests\nto a halt.\n\nRather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we\u2019ll have a fixed number of\nthreads waiting in the pool. Requests that come in are sent to the pool for\nprocessing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the\nthreads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request,\nand then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process up\nto _`N`_ requests concurrently, where _`N`_ is the number of threads. If each\nthread is responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still\nback up in the queue, but we\u2019ve increased the number of long-running requests\nwe can handle before reaching that point.\n\nThis technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a web\nserver. Other options you might explore are the fork/join model, the\nsingle-threaded async I/O model, and the multithreaded async I/O model. If\nyou\u2019re interested in this topic, you can read more about other solutions and\ntry to implement them; with a low-level language like Rust, all of these\noptions are possible.\n\nBefore we begin implementing a thread pool, let\u2019s talk about what using the\npool should look like. When you\u2019re trying to design code, writing the client\ninterface first can help guide your design. Write the API of the code so that\nit\u2019s structured in the way you want to call it; then, implement the\nfunctionality within that structure rather than implementing the functionality\nand then designing the public API.\n\nSimilar to how we used test-driven development in the project in Chapter 12,\nwe\u2019ll use compiler-driven development here. We\u2019ll write the code that calls the\nfunctions we want, and then we\u2019ll look at errors from the compiler to determine\nwhat we should change next to get the code to work. Before we do that, however,\nwe\u2019ll explore the technique we\u2019re not going to use as a starting point.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"code-structure-if-we-could-spawn-a-thread-for-each-request\"></a>\n\n#### Spawning a Thread for Each Request\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explore how our code might look if it did create a new thread for\nevery connection. As mentioned earlier, this isn\u2019t our final plan due to the\nproblems with potentially spawning an unlimited number of threads, but it is a\nstarting point to get a working multithreaded server first. Then, we\u2019ll add the\nthread pool as an improvement, and contrasting the two solutions will be easier.\n\nListing 21-11 shows the changes to make to `main` to spawn a new thread to\nhandle each stream within the `for` loop.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-11\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Spawning a new thread for each stream\">\n\n```rust,no_run\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-11/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAs you learned in Chapter 16, `thread::spawn` will create a new thread and then\nrun the code in the closure in the new thread. If you run this code and load\n_/sleep_ in your browser, then _/_ in two more browser tabs, you\u2019ll indeed see\nthat the requests to _/_ don\u2019t have to wait for _/sleep_ to finish. However, as\nwe mentioned, this will eventually overwhelm the system because you\u2019d be making\nnew threads without any limit.\n\nYou may also recall from Chapter 17 that this is exactly the kind of situation\nwhere async and await really shine! Keep that in mind as we build the thread\npool and think about how things would look different or the same with async.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"creating-a-similar-interface-for-a-finite-number-of-threads\"></a>\n\n#### Creating a Finite Number of Threads\n\nWe want our thread pool to work in a similar, familiar way so that switching\nfrom threads to a thread pool doesn\u2019t require large changes to the code that\nuses our API. Listing 21-12 shows the hypothetical interface for a `ThreadPool`\nstruct we want to use instead of `thread::spawn`.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-12\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Our ideal `ThreadPool` interface\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-12/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe use `ThreadPool::new` to create a new thread pool with a configurable number\nof threads, in this case four. Then, in the `for` loop, `pool.execute` has a\nsimilar interface as `thread::spawn` in that it takes a closure that the pool\nshould run for each stream. We need to implement `pool.execute` so that it\ntakes the closure and gives it to a thread in the pool to run. This code won\u2019t\nyet compile, but we\u2019ll try so that the compiler can guide us in how to fix it.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n\n<a id=\"building-the-threadpool-struct-using-compiler-driven-development\"></a>\n\n#### Building `ThreadPool` Using Compiler-Driven Development\n\nMake the changes in Listing 21-12 to _src/main.rs_, and then let\u2019s use the\ncompiler errors from `cargo check` to drive our development. Here is the first\nerror we get:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-12/output.txt}}\n```\n\nGreat! This error tells us we need a `ThreadPool` type or module, so we\u2019ll\nbuild one now. Our `ThreadPool` implementation will be independent of the kind\nof work our web server is doing. So, let\u2019s switch the `hello` crate from a\nbinary crate to a library crate to hold our `ThreadPool` implementation. After\nwe change to a library crate, we could also use the separate thread pool\nlibrary for any work we want to do using a thread pool, not just for serving\nweb requests.\n\nCreate a _src/lib.rs_ file that contains the following, which is the simplest\ndefinition of a `ThreadPool` struct that we can have for now:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-01-define-threadpool-struct/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\n\nThen, edit the _main.rs_ file to bring `ThreadPool` into scope from the library\ncrate by adding the following code to the top of _src/main.rs_:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-01-define-threadpool-struct/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code still won\u2019t work, but let\u2019s check it again to get the next error that\nwe need to address:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-01-define-threadpool-struct/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThis error indicates that next we need to create an associated function named\n`new` for `ThreadPool`. We also know that `new` needs to have one parameter\nthat can accept `4` as an argument and should return a `ThreadPool` instance.\nLet\u2019s implement the simplest `new` function that will have those\ncharacteristics:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-02-impl-threadpool-new/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe chose `usize` as the type of the `size` parameter because we know that a\nnegative number of threads doesn\u2019t make any sense. We also know we\u2019ll use this\n`4` as the number of elements in a collection of threads, which is what the\n`usize` type is for, as discussed in the [\u201cInteger Types\u201d][integer-types]<!--\nignore --> section in Chapter 3.\n\nLet\u2019s check the code again:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-02-impl-threadpool-new/output.txt}}\n```\n\nNow the error occurs because we don\u2019t have an `execute` method on `ThreadPool`.\nRecall from the [\u201cCreating a Finite Number of\nThreads\u201d](#creating-a-finite-number-of-threads)<!-- ignore --> section that we\ndecided our thread pool should have an interface similar to `thread::spawn`. In\naddition, we\u2019ll implement the `execute` function so that it takes the closure\nit\u2019s given and gives it to an idle thread in the pool to run.\n\nWe\u2019ll define the `execute` method on `ThreadPool` to take a closure as a\nparameter. Recall from the [\u201cMoving Captured Values Out of\nClosures\u201d][moving-out-of-closures]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 13 that we can\ntake closures as parameters with three different traits: `Fn`, `FnMut`, and\n`FnOnce`. We need to decide which kind of closure to use here. We know we\u2019ll\nend up doing something similar to the standard library `thread::spawn`\nimplementation, so we can look at what bounds the signature of `thread::spawn`\nhas on its parameter. The documentation shows us the following:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -> T,\n        F: Send + 'static,\n        T: Send + 'static,\n```\n\nThe `F` type parameter is the one we\u2019re concerned with here; the `T` type\nparameter is related to the return value, and we\u2019re not concerned with that. We\ncan see that `spawn` uses `FnOnce` as the trait bound on `F`. This is probably\nwhat we want as well, because we\u2019ll eventually pass the argument we get in\n`execute` to `spawn`. We can be further confident that `FnOnce` is the trait we\nwant to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that\nrequest\u2019s closure one time, which matches the `Once` in `FnOnce`.\n\nThe `F` type parameter also has the trait bound `Send` and the lifetime bound\n`'static`, which are useful in our situation: We need `Send` to transfer the\nclosure from one thread to another and `'static` because we don\u2019t know how long\nthe thread will take to execute. Let\u2019s create an `execute` method on\n`ThreadPool` that will take a generic parameter of type `F` with these bounds:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-03-define-execute/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe still use the `()` after `FnOnce` because this `FnOnce` represents a closure\nthat takes no parameters and returns the unit type `()`. Just like function\ndefinitions, the return type can be omitted from the signature, but even if we\nhave no parameters, we still need the parentheses.\n\nAgain, this is the simplest implementation of the `execute` method: It does\nnothing, but we\u2019re only trying to make our code compile. Let\u2019s check it again:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-03-define-execute/output.txt}}\n```\n\nIt compiles! But note that if you try `cargo run` and make a request in the\nbrowser, you\u2019ll see the errors in the browser that we saw at the beginning of\nthe chapter. Our library isn\u2019t actually calling the closure passed to `execute`\nyet!\n\n> Note: A saying you might hear about languages with strict compilers, such as\n> Haskell and Rust, is \u201cIf the code compiles, it works.\u201d But this saying is not\n> universally true. Our project compiles, but it does absolutely nothing! If we\n> were building a real, complete project, this would be a good time to start\n> writing unit tests to check that the code compiles _and_ has the behavior we\n> want.\n\nConsider: What would be different here if we were going to execute a future\ninstead of a closure?\n\n#### Validating the Number of Threads in `new`\n\nWe aren\u2019t doing anything with the parameters to `new` and `execute`. Let\u2019s\nimplement the bodies of these functions with the behavior we want. To start,\nlet\u2019s think about `new`. Earlier we chose an unsigned type for the `size`\nparameter because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense.\nHowever, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly\nvalid `usize`. We\u2019ll add code to check that `size` is greater than zero before\nwe return a `ThreadPool` instance, and we\u2019ll have the program panic if it\nreceives a zero by using the `assert!` macro, as shown in Listing 21-13.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-13\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Implementing `ThreadPool::new` to panic if `size` is zero\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-13/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve also added some documentation for our `ThreadPool` with doc comments.\nNote that we followed good documentation practices by adding a section that\ncalls out the situations in which our function can panic, as discussed in\nChapter 14. Try running `cargo doc --open` and clicking the `ThreadPool` struct\nto see what the generated docs for `new` look like!\n\nInstead of adding the `assert!` macro as we\u2019ve done here, we could change `new`\ninto `build` and return a `Result` like we did with `Config::build` in the I/O\nproject in Listing 12-9. But we\u2019ve decided in this case that trying to create a\nthread pool without any threads should be an unrecoverable error. If you\u2019re\nfeeling ambitious, try to write a function named `build` with the following\nsignature to compare with the `new` function:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn build(size: usize) -> Result<ThreadPool, PoolCreationError> {\n```\n\n#### Creating Space to Store the Threads\n\nNow that we have a way to know we have a valid number of threads to store in\nthe pool, we can create those threads and store them in the `ThreadPool` struct\nbefore returning the struct. But how do we \u201cstore\u201d a thread? Let\u2019s take another\nlook at the `thread::spawn` signature:\n\n```rust,ignore\npub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -> T,\n        F: Send + 'static,\n        T: Send + 'static,\n```\n\nThe `spawn` function returns a `JoinHandle<T>`, where `T` is the type that the\nclosure returns. Let\u2019s try using `JoinHandle` too and see what happens. In our\ncase, the closures we\u2019re passing to the thread pool will handle the connection\nand not return anything, so `T` will be the unit type `()`.\n\nThe code in Listing 21-14 will compile, but it doesn\u2019t create any threads yet.\nWe\u2019ve changed the definition of `ThreadPool` to hold a vector of\n`thread::JoinHandle<()>` instances, initialized the vector with a capacity of\n`size`, set up a `for` loop that will run some code to create the threads, and\nreturned a `ThreadPool` instance containing them.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-14\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Creating a vector for `ThreadPool` to hold the threads\">\n\n```rust,ignore,not_desired_behavior\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-14/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve brought `std::thread` into scope in the library crate because we\u2019re\nusing `thread::JoinHandle` as the type of the items in the vector in\n`ThreadPool`.\n\nOnce a valid size is received, our `ThreadPool` creates a new vector that can\nhold `size` items. The `with_capacity` function performs the same task as\n`Vec::new` but with an important difference: It pre-allocates space in the\nvector. Because we know we need to store `size` elements in the vector, doing\nthis allocation up front is slightly more efficient than using `Vec::new`,\nwhich resizes itself as elements are inserted.\n\nWhen you run `cargo check` again, it should succeed.\n\n<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->\n<a id =\"a-worker-struct-responsible-for-sending-code-from-the-threadpool-to-a-thread\"></a>\n\n#### Sending Code from the `ThreadPool` to a Thread\n\nWe left a comment in the `for` loop in Listing 21-14 regarding the creation of\nthreads. Here, we\u2019ll look at how we actually create threads. The standard\nlibrary provides `thread::spawn` as a way to create threads, and\n`thread::spawn` expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the\nthread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have\nthem _wait_ for code that we\u2019ll send later. The standard library\u2019s\nimplementation of threads doesn\u2019t include any way to do that; we have to\nimplement it manually.\n\nWe\u2019ll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure between the\n`ThreadPool` and the threads that will manage this new behavior. We\u2019ll call\nthis data structure _Worker_, which is a common term in pooling\nimplementations. The `Worker` picks up code that needs to be run and runs the\ncode in its thread.\n\nThink of people working in the kitchen at a restaurant: The workers wait until\norders come in from customers, and then they\u2019re responsible for taking those\norders and filling them.\n\nInstead of storing a vector of `JoinHandle<()>` instances in the thread pool,\nwe\u2019ll store instances of the `Worker` struct. Each `Worker` will store a single\n`JoinHandle<()>` instance. Then, we\u2019ll implement a method on `Worker` that will\ntake a closure of code to run and send it to the already running thread for\nexecution. We\u2019ll also give each `Worker` an `id` so that we can distinguish\nbetween the different instances of `Worker` in the pool when logging or\ndebugging.\n\nHere is the new process that will happen when we create a `ThreadPool`. We\u2019ll\nimplement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we have `Worker`\nset up in this way:\n\n1. Define a `Worker` struct that holds an `id` and a `JoinHandle<()>`.\n2. Change `ThreadPool` to hold a vector of `Worker` instances.\n3. Define a `Worker::new` function that takes an `id` number and returns a\n   `Worker` instance that holds the `id` and a thread spawned with an empty\n   closure.\n4. In `ThreadPool::new`, use the `for` loop counter to generate an `id`, create\n   a new `Worker` with that `id`, and store the `Worker` in the vector.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before\nlooking at the code in Listing 21-15.\n\nReady? Here is Listing 21-15 with one way to make the preceding modifications.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-15\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Modifying `ThreadPool` to hold `Worker` instances instead of holding threads directly\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-15/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve changed the name of the field on `ThreadPool` from `threads` to `workers`\nbecause it\u2019s now holding `Worker` instances instead of `JoinHandle<()>`\ninstances. We use the counter in the `for` loop as an argument to\n`Worker::new`, and we store each new `Worker` in the vector named `workers`.\n\nExternal code (like our server in _src/main.rs_) doesn\u2019t need to know the\nimplementation details regarding using a `Worker` struct within `ThreadPool`,\nso we make the `Worker` struct and its `new` function private. The\n`Worker::new` function uses the `id` we give it and stores a `JoinHandle<()>`\ninstance that is created by spawning a new thread using an empty closure.\n\n> Note: If the operating system can\u2019t create a thread because there aren\u2019t\n> enough system resources, `thread::spawn` will panic. That will cause our\n> whole server to panic, even though the creation of some threads might\n> succeed. For simplicity\u2019s sake, this behavior is fine, but in a production\n> thread pool implementation, you\u2019d likely want to use\n> [`std::thread::Builder`][builder]<!-- ignore --> and its\n> [`spawn`][builder-spawn]<!-- ignore --> method that returns `Result` instead.\n\nThis code will compile and will store the number of `Worker` instances we\nspecified as an argument to `ThreadPool::new`. But we\u2019re _still_ not processing\nthe closure that we get in `execute`. Let\u2019s look at how to do that next.\n\n#### Sending Requests to Threads via Channels\n\nThe next problem we\u2019ll tackle is that the closures given to `thread::spawn` do\nabsolutely nothing. Currently, we get the closure we want to execute in the\n`execute` method. But we need to give `thread::spawn` a closure to run when we\ncreate each `Worker` during the creation of the `ThreadPool`.\n\nWe want the `Worker` structs that we just created to fetch the code to run from\na queue held in the `ThreadPool` and send that code to its thread to run.\n\nThe channels we learned about in Chapter 16\u2014a simple way to communicate between\ntwo threads\u2014would be perfect for this use case. We\u2019ll use a channel to function\nas the queue of jobs, and `execute` will send a job from the `ThreadPool` to\nthe `Worker` instances, which will send the job to its thread. Here is the plan:\n\n1. The `ThreadPool` will create a channel and hold on to the sender.\n2. Each `Worker` will hold on to the receiver.\n3. We\u2019ll create a new `Job` struct that will hold the closures we want to send\n   down the channel.\n4. The `execute` method will send the job it wants to execute through the\n   sender.\n5. In its thread, the `Worker` will loop over its receiver and execute the\n   closures of any jobs it receives.\n\nLet\u2019s start by creating a channel in `ThreadPool::new` and holding the sender\nin the `ThreadPool` instance, as shown in Listing 21-16. The `Job` struct\ndoesn\u2019t hold anything for now but will be the type of item we\u2019re sending down\nthe channel.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-16\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Modifying `ThreadPool` to store the sender of a channel that transmits `Job` instances\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-16/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn `ThreadPool::new`, we create our new channel and have the pool hold the\nsender. This will successfully compile.\n\nLet\u2019s try passing a receiver of the channel into each `Worker` as the thread\npool creates the channel. We know we want to use the receiver in the thread that\nthe `Worker` instances spawn, so we\u2019ll reference the `receiver` parameter in the\nclosure. The code in Listing 21-17 won\u2019t quite compile yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-17\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Passing the receiver to each `Worker`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-17/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe\u2019ve made some small and straightforward changes: We pass the receiver into\n`Worker::new`, and then we use it inside the closure.\n\nWhen we try to check this code, we get this error:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-17/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe code is trying to pass `receiver` to multiple `Worker` instances. This\nwon\u2019t work, as you\u2019ll recall from Chapter 16: The channel implementation that\nRust provides is multiple _producer_, single _consumer_. This means we can\u2019t\njust clone the consuming end of the channel to fix this code. We also don\u2019t\nwant to send a message multiple times to multiple consumers; we want one list\nof messages with multiple `Worker` instances such that each message gets\nprocessed once.\n\nAdditionally, taking a job off the channel queue involves mutating the\n`receiver`, so the threads need a safe way to share and modify `receiver`;\notherwise, we might get race conditions (as covered in Chapter 16).\n\nRecall the thread-safe smart pointers discussed in Chapter 16: To share\nownership across multiple threads and allow the threads to mutate the value, we\nneed to use `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. The `Arc` type will let multiple `Worker` instances\nown the receiver, and `Mutex` will ensure that only one `Worker` gets a job from\nthe receiver at a time. Listing 21-18 shows the changes we need to make.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-18\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Sharing the receiver among the `Worker` instances using `Arc` and `Mutex`\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-18/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nIn `ThreadPool::new`, we put the receiver in an `Arc` and a `Mutex`. For each\nnew `Worker`, we clone the `Arc` to bump the reference count so that the\n`Worker` instances can share ownership of the receiver.\n\nWith these changes, the code compiles! We\u2019re getting there!\n\n#### Implementing the `execute` Method\n\nLet\u2019s finally implement the `execute` method on `ThreadPool`. We\u2019ll also change\n`Job` from a struct to a type alias for a trait object that holds the type of\nclosure that `execute` receives. As discussed in the [\u201cType Synonyms and Type\nAliases\u201d][type-aliases]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 20, type aliases\nallow us to make long types shorter for ease of use. Look at Listing 21-19.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-19\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Creating a `Job` type alias for a `Box` that holds each closure and then sending the job down the channel\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-19/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nAfter creating a new `Job` instance using the closure we get in `execute`, we\nsend that job down the sending end of the channel. We\u2019re calling `unwrap` on\n`send` for the case that sending fails. This might happen if, for example, we\nstop all our threads from executing, meaning the receiving end has stopped\nreceiving new messages. At the moment, we can\u2019t stop our threads from\nexecuting: Our threads continue executing as long as the pool exists. The\nreason we use `unwrap` is that we know the failure case won\u2019t happen, but the\ncompiler doesn\u2019t know that.\n\nBut we\u2019re not quite done yet! In the `Worker`, our closure being passed to\n`thread::spawn` still only _references_ the receiving end of the channel.\nInstead, we need the closure to loop forever, asking the receiving end of the\nchannel for a job and running the job when it gets one. Let\u2019s make the change\nshown in Listing 21-20 to `Worker::new`.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-20\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Receiving and executing the jobs in the `Worker` instance\u2019s thread\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-20/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nHere, we first call `lock` on the `receiver` to acquire the mutex, and then we\ncall `unwrap` to panic on any errors. Acquiring a lock might fail if the mutex\nis in a _poisoned_ state, which can happen if some other thread panicked while\nholding the lock rather than releasing the lock. In this situation, calling\n`unwrap` to have this thread panic is the correct action to take. Feel free to\nchange this `unwrap` to an `expect` with an error message that is meaningful to\nyou.\n\nIf we get the lock on the mutex, we call `recv` to receive a `Job` from the\nchannel. A final `unwrap` moves past any errors here as well, which might occur\nif the thread holding the sender has shut down, similar to how the `send`\nmethod returns `Err` if the receiver shuts down.\n\nThe call to `recv` blocks, so if there is no job yet, the current thread will\nwait until a job becomes available. The `Mutex<T>` ensures that only one\n`Worker` thread at a time is trying to request a job.\n\nOur thread pool is now in a working state! Give it a `cargo run` and make some\nrequests:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-20\ncargo run\nmake some requests to 127.0.0.1:7878\nCan't automate because the output depends on making requests\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)\nwarning: field `workers` is never read\n --> src/lib.rs:7:5\n  |\n6 | pub struct ThreadPool {\n  |            ---------- field in this struct\n7 |     workers: Vec<Worker>,\n  |     ^^^^^^^\n  |\n  = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default\n\nwarning: fields `id` and `thread` are never read\n  --> src/lib.rs:48:5\n   |\n47 | struct Worker {\n   |        ------ fields in this struct\n48 |     id: usize,\n   |     ^^\n49 |     thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>,\n   |     ^^^^^^\n\nwarning: `hello` (lib) generated 2 warnings\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.91s\n     Running `target/debug/hello`\nWorker 0 got a job; executing.\nWorker 2 got a job; executing.\nWorker 1 got a job; executing.\nWorker 3 got a job; executing.\nWorker 0 got a job; executing.\nWorker 2 got a job; executing.\nWorker 1 got a job; executing.\nWorker 3 got a job; executing.\nWorker 0 got a job; executing.\nWorker 2 got a job; executing.\n```\n\nSuccess! We now have a thread pool that executes connections asynchronously.\nThere are never more than four threads created, so our system won\u2019t get\noverloaded if the server receives a lot of requests. If we make a request to\n_/sleep_, the server will be able to serve other requests by having another\nthread run them.\n\n> Note: If you open _/sleep_ in multiple browser windows simultaneously, they\n> might load one at a time in five-second intervals. Some web browsers execute\n> multiple instances of the same request sequentially for caching reasons. This\n> limitation is not caused by our web server.\n\nThis is a good time to pause and consider how the code in Listings 21-18, 21-19,\nand 21-20 would be different if we were using futures instead of a closure for\nthe work to be done. What types would change? How would the method signatures be\ndifferent, if at all? What parts of the code would stay the same?\n\nAfter learning about the `while let` loop in Chapter 17 and Chapter 19, you\nmight be wondering why we didn\u2019t write the `Worker` thread code as shown in\nListing 21-21.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-21\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"An alternative implementation of `Worker::new` using `while let`\">\n\n```rust,ignore,not_desired_behavior\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-21/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis code compiles and runs but doesn\u2019t result in the desired threading\nbehavior: A slow request will still cause other requests to wait to be\nprocessed. The reason is somewhat subtle: The `Mutex` struct has no public\n`unlock` method because the ownership of the lock is based on the lifetime of\nthe `MutexGuard<T>` within the `LockResult<MutexGuard<T>>` that the `lock`\nmethod returns. At compile time, the borrow checker can then enforce the rule\nthat a resource guarded by a `Mutex` cannot be accessed unless we hold the\nlock. However, this implementation can also result in the lock being held\nlonger than intended if we aren\u2019t mindful of the lifetime of the\n`MutexGuard<T>`.\n\nThe code in Listing 21-20 that uses `let job =\nreceiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();` works because with `let`, any\ntemporary values used in the expression on the right-hand side of the equal\nsign are immediately dropped when the `let` statement ends. However, `while\nlet` (and `if let` and `match`) does not drop temporary values until the end of\nthe associated block. In Listing 21-21, the lock remains held for the duration\nof the call to `job()`, meaning other `Worker` instances cannot receive jobs.\n\n[type-aliases]: ch20-03-advanced-types.html#type-synonyms-and-type-aliases\n[integer-types]: ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types\n[moving-out-of-closures]: ch13-01-closures.html#moving-captured-values-out-of-closures\n[builder]: ../std/thread/struct.Builder.html\n[builder-spawn]: ../std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn",

    "content": "Let\u2019s start with implementing `Drop` on our thread pool. When the pool is\ndropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their work.\nListing 21-22 shows a first attempt at a `Drop` implementation; this code won\u2019t\nquite work yet.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-22\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Joining each thread when the thread pool goes out of scope\">\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-22/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nFirst, we loop through each of the thread pool `workers`. We use `&mut` for this\nbecause `self` is a mutable reference, and we also need to be able to mutate\n`worker`. For each `worker`, we print a message saying that this particular\n`Worker` instance is shutting down, and then we call `join` on that `Worker`\ninstance\u2019s thread. If the call to `join` fails, we use `unwrap` to make Rust\npanic and go into an ungraceful shutdown.\n\nHere is the error we get when we compile this code:\n\n```console\n{{#include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-22/output.txt}}\n```\n\nThe error tells us we can\u2019t call `join` because we only have a mutable borrow\nof each `worker` and `join` takes ownership of its argument. To solve this\nissue, we need to move the thread out of the `Worker` instance that owns\n`thread` so that `join` can consume the thread. One way to do this is to take\nthe same approach we took in Listing 18-15. If `Worker` held an\n`Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>`, we could call the `take` method on the\n`Option` to move the value out of the `Some` variant and leave a `None` variant\nin its place. In other words, a `Worker` that is running would have a `Some`\nvariant in `thread`, and when we wanted to clean up a `Worker`, we\u2019d replace\n`Some` with `None` so that the `Worker` wouldn\u2019t have a thread to run.\n\nHowever, the _only_ time this would come up would be when dropping the\n`Worker`. In exchange, we\u2019d have to deal with an\n`Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>` anywhere we accessed `worker.thread`.\nIdiomatic Rust uses `Option` quite a bit, but when you find yourself wrapping\nsomething you know will always be present in an `Option` as a workaround like\nthis, it\u2019s a good idea to look for alternative approaches to make your code\ncleaner and less error-prone.\n\nIn this case, a better alternative exists: the `Vec::drain` method. It accepts\na range parameter to specify which items to remove from the vector and returns\nan iterator of those items. Passing the `..` range syntax will remove *every*\nvalue from the vector.\n\nSo, we need to update the `ThreadPool` `drop` implementation like this:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-04-update-drop-definition/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nThis resolves the compiler error and does not require any other changes to our\ncode. Note that, because drop can be called when panicking, the unwrap\ncould also panic and cause a double panic, which immediately crashes the\nprogram and ends any cleanup in progress. This is fine for an example program,\nbut it isn\u2019t recommended for production code.",

    "content": "With all the changes we\u2019ve made, our code compiles without any warnings.\nHowever, the bad news is that this code doesn\u2019t function the way we want it to\nyet. The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the `Worker`\ninstances: At the moment, we call `join`, but that won\u2019t shut down the threads,\nbecause they `loop` forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our\n`ThreadPool` with our current implementation of `drop`, the main thread will\nblock forever, waiting for the first thread to finish.\n\nTo fix this problem, we\u2019ll need a change in the `ThreadPool` `drop`\nimplementation and then a change in the `Worker` loop.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll change the `ThreadPool` `drop` implementation to explicitly drop\nthe `sender` before waiting for the threads to finish. Listing 21-23 shows the\nchanges to `ThreadPool` to explicitly drop `sender`. Unlike with the thread,\nhere we _do_ need to use an `Option` to be able to move `sender` out of\n`ThreadPool` with `Option::take`.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-23\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Explicitly dropping `sender` before joining the `Worker` threads\">\n\n```rust,noplayground,not_desired_behavior\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-23/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nDropping `sender` closes the channel, which indicates no more messages will be\nsent. When that happens, all the calls to `recv` that the `Worker` instances do\nin the infinite loop will return an error. In Listing 21-24, we change the\n`Worker` loop to gracefully exit the loop in that case, which means the threads\nwill finish when the `ThreadPool` `drop` implementation calls `join` on them.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-24\" file-name=\"src/lib.rs\" caption=\"Explicitly breaking out of the loop when `recv` returns an error\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-24/src/lib.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nTo see this code in action, let\u2019s modify `main` to accept only two requests\nbefore gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 21-25.\n\n<Listing number=\"21-25\" file-name=\"src/main.rs\" caption=\"Shutting down the server after serving two requests by exiting the loop\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-25/src/main.rs:here}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving only two\nrequests. This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is\nin working order.\n\nThe `take` method is defined in the `Iterator` trait and limits the iteration\nto the first two items at most. The `ThreadPool` will go out of scope at the\nend of `main`, and the `drop` implementation will run.\n\nStart the server with `cargo run` and make three requests. The third request\nshould error, and in your terminal, you should see output similar to this:\n\n<!-- manual-regeneration\ncd listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-25\ncargo run\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:7878\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:7878\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:7878\nthird request will error because server will have shut down\ncopy output below\nCan't automate because the output depends on making requests\n-->\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s\n     Running `target/debug/hello`\nWorker 0 got a job; executing.\nShutting down.\nShutting down worker 0\nWorker 3 got a job; executing.\nWorker 1 disconnected; shutting down.\nWorker 2 disconnected; shutting down.\nWorker 3 disconnected; shutting down.\nWorker 0 disconnected; shutting down.\nShutting down worker 1\nShutting down worker 2\nShutting down worker 3\n```\n\nYou might see a different ordering of `Worker` IDs and messages printed. We can\nsee how this code works from the messages: `Worker` instances 0 and 3 got the\nfirst two requests. The server stopped accepting connections after the second\nconnection, and the `Drop` implementation on `ThreadPool` starts executing\nbefore `Worker 3` even starts its job. Dropping the `sender` disconnects all the\n`Worker` instances and tells them to shut down. The `Worker` instances each\nprint a message when they disconnect, and then the thread pool calls `join` to\nwait for each `Worker` thread to finish.\n\nNotice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: The `ThreadPool`\ndropped the `sender`, and before any `Worker` received an error, we tried to\njoin `Worker 0`. `Worker 0` had not yet gotten an error from `recv`, so the main\nthread blocked, waiting for `Worker 0` to finish. In the meantime, `Worker 3`\nreceived a job and then all threads received an error. When `Worker 0` finished,\nthe main thread waited for the rest of the `Worker` instances to finish. At that\npoint, they had all exited their loops and stopped.\n\nCongrats! We\u2019ve now completed our project; we have a basic web server that uses\na thread pool to respond asynchronously. We\u2019re able to perform a graceful\nshutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.\n\nHere\u2019s the full code for reference:\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/main.rs\">\n\n```rust,ignore\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-07-final-code/src/main.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\n<Listing file-name=\"src/lib.rs\">\n\n```rust,noplayground\n{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch21-web-server/no-listing-07-final-code/src/lib.rs}}\n```\n\n</Listing>\n\nWe could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are\nsome ideas:\n\n- Add more documentation to `ThreadPool` and its public methods.\n- Add tests of the library\u2019s functionality.\n- Change calls to `unwrap` to more robust error handling.\n- Use `ThreadPool` to perform some task other than serving web requests.\n- Find a thread pool crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and implement a\n  similar web server using the crate instead. Then, compare its API and\n  robustness to the thread pool we implemented.\n\n## Summary\n\nWell done! You\u2019ve made it to the end of the book!

    "content": "_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#`.\n\nFor example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust,ignore,does_not_compile\nfn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou\u2019ll get this error:\n\n```text\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword `match`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can\u2019t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\n<span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span>\n\n```rust\nfn r#match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    assert!(r#match(\"foo\", \"foobar\"));\n}\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main`.\n\nRaw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren\u2019t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses.\nFor example, `try` isn\u2019t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions. If you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you\u2019ll need to use the raw identifier syntax,\n`r#try` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.\nSee [Appendix E][appendix-e]<!-- ignore --> for more information on editions.\n\n[appendix-e]: appendix-05-editions.html",

The `derive` attribute generates\ncode that will implement a trait with its own default implementation on the\ntype you\u2019ve annotated with the `derive` syntax.\n\nIn this appendix, we provide a reference of all the traits in the standard\nlibrary that you can use with `derive`. Each section covers:\n\n- What operators and methods deriving this trait will enable\n- What the implementation of the trait provided by `derive` does\n- What implementing the trait signifies about the type\n- The conditions in which you\u2019re allowed or not allowed to implement the trait\n- Examples of operations that require the trait\n\nIf you want different behavior from that provided by the `derive` attribute,\nconsult the [standard library documentation](../std/index.html)<!-- ignore -->\nfor each trait for details on how to manually implement them.\n\nThe traits listed here are the only ones defined by the standard library that\ncan be implemented on your types using `derive`. Other traits defined in the\nstandard library don\u2019t have sensible default behavior, so it\u2019s up to you to\nimplement them in the way that makes sense for what you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nAn example of a trait that can\u2019t be derived is `Display`, which handles\nformatting for end users. You should always consider the appropriate way to\ndisplay a type to an end user. What parts of the type should an end user be\nallowed to see? What parts would they find relevant? What format of the data\nwould be most relevant to them? The Rust compiler doesn\u2019t have this insight, so\nit can\u2019t provide appropriate default behavior for you.\n\nThe list of derivable traits provided in this appendix is not comprehensive:\nLibraries can implement `derive` for their own traits, making the list of\ntraits you can use `derive` with truly open ended. Implementing `derive`\ninvolves using a procedural macro, which is covered in the [\u201cCustom `derive`\nMacros\u201d][custom-derive-macros]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 20.",

    "content": "The `PartialEq` trait allows you to compare instances of a type to check for\nequality and enables use of the `==` and `!=` operators.\n\nDeriving `PartialEq` implements the `eq` method. When `PartialEq` is derived on\nstructs, two instances are equal only if _all_ fields are equal, and the\ninstances are not equal if _any_ fields are not equal. When derived on enums,\neach variant is equal to itself and not equal to the other variants.\n\nThe `PartialEq` trait is required, for example, with the use of the\n`assert_eq!` macro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a type\nfor equality.\n\nThe `Eq` trait has no methods. Its purpose is to signal that for every value of\nthe annotated type, the value is equal to itself. The `Eq` trait can only be\napplied to types that also implement `PartialEq`, although not all types that\nimplement `PartialEq` can implement `Eq`. One example of this is floating-point\nnumber types: The implementation of floating-point numbers states that two\ninstances of the not-a-number (`NaN`) value are not equal to each other.\n\nAn example of when `Eq` is required is for keys in a `HashMap<K, V>` so that\nthe `HashMap<K, V>` can tell whether two keys are the same.",

You can only apply the `PartialOrd` trait to types\nthat also implement `PartialEq`.\n\nDeriving `PartialOrd` implements the `partial_cmp` method, which returns an\n`Option<Ordering>` that will be `None` when the values given don\u2019t produce an\nordering. An example of a value that doesn\u2019t produce an ordering, even though\nmost values of that type can be compared, is the `NaN` floating point value.\nCalling `partial_cmp` with any floating-point number and the `NaN`\nfloating-point value will return `None`.\n\nWhen derived on structs, `PartialOrd` compares two instances by comparing the\nvalue in each field in the order in which the fields appear in the struct\ndefinition. When derived on enums, variants of the enum declared earlier in the\nenum definition are considered less than the variants listed later.\n\nThe `PartialOrd` trait is required, for example, for the `gen_range` method\nfrom the `rand` crate that generates a random value in the range specified by a\nrange expression.\n\nThe `Ord` trait allows you to know that for any two values of the annotated\ntype, a valid ordering will exist. The `Ord` trait implements the `cmp` method,\nwhich returns an `Ordering` rather than an `Option<Ordering>` because a valid\nordering will always be possible. You can only apply the `Ord` trait to types\nthat also implement `PartialOrd` and `Eq` (and `Eq` requires `PartialEq`). When\nderived on structs and enums, `cmp` behaves the same way as the derived\nimplementation for `partial_cmp` does with `PartialOrd`.\n\nAn example of when `Ord` is required is when storing values in a `BTreeSet<T>`,\na data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.",

This means all the\nfields or values in the type must also implement `Clone` to derive `Clone`.\n\nAn example of when `Clone` is required is when calling the `to_vec` method on a\nslice. The slice doesn\u2019t own the type instances it contains, but the vector\nreturned from `to_vec` will need to own its instances, so `to_vec` calls\n`clone` on each item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement `Clone`.\n\nThe `Copy` trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits stored on\nthe stack; no arbitrary code is necessary.

A type that\nimplements `Copy` must also implement `Clone` because a type that implements\n`Copy` has a trivial implementation of `Clone` that performs the same task as\n`Copy`.\n\nThe `Copy` trait is rarely required; types that implement `Copy` have\noptimizations available, meaning you don\u2019t have to call `clone`, which makes\nthe code more concise.\n\nEverything possible with `Copy` you can also accomplish with `Clone`, but the\ncode might be slower or have to use `clone` in places.",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "## Appendix E: Editions\n\nIn Chapter 1, you saw that `cargo new` adds a bit of metadata to your\n_Cargo.toml_ file about an edition. This appendix talks about what that means!\n\nThe Rust language and compiler have a six-week release cycle, meaning users get\na constant stream of new features. Other programming languages release larger\nchanges less often; Rust releases smaller updates more frequently. After a\nwhile, all of these tiny changes add up. But from release to release, it can be\ndifficult to look back and say, \u201cWow, between Rust 1.10 and Rust 1.31, Rust has\nchanged a lot!\u201d\n\nEvery three years or so, the Rust team produces a new Rust _edition_. Each\nedition brings together the features that have landed into a clear package with\nfully updated documentation and tooling. New editions ship as part of the usual\nsix-week release process.\n\nEditions serve different purposes for different people:\n\n- For active Rust users, a new edition brings together incremental changes into\n  an easy-to-understand package.\n- For non-users, a new edition signals that some major advancements have\n  landed, which might make Rust worth another look.\n- For those developing Rust, a new edition provides a rallying point for the\n  project as a whole.\n\nAt the time of this writing, four Rust editions are available: Rust 2015, Rust\n2018, Rust 2021, and Rust 2024. This book is written using Rust 2024 edition\nidioms.\n\nThe `edition` key in _Cargo.toml_ indicates which edition the compiler should\nuse for your code. If the key doesn\u2019t exist, Rust uses `2015` as the edition\nvalue for backward compatibility reasons.\n\nEach project can opt in to an edition other than the default 2015 edition.\nEditions can contain incompatible changes, such as including a new keyword that\nconflicts with identifiers in code. However, unless you opt in to those\nchanges, your code will continue to compile even as you upgrade the Rust\ncompiler version you use.\n\nAll Rust compiler versions support any edition that existed prior to that\ncompiler\u2019s release, and they can link crates of any supported editions\ntogether. Edition changes only affect the way the compiler initially parses\ncode. Therefore, if you\u2019re using Rust 2015 and one of your dependencies uses\nRust 2018, your project will compile and be able to use that dependency. The\nopposite situation, where your project uses Rust 2018 and a dependency uses\nRust 2015, works as well.\n\nTo be clear: Most features will be available on all editions. Developers using\nany Rust edition will continue to see improvements as new stable releases are\nmade. However, in some cases, mainly when new keywords are added, some new\nfeatures might only be available in later editions. You will need to switch\neditions if you want to take advantage of such features.\n\nFor more details, see [_The Rust Edition Guide_][edition-guide]. This is a\ncomplete book that enumerates the differences between editions and explains how\nto automatically upgrade your code to a new edition via `cargo fix`.\n\n[edition-guide]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/edition-guide",

    "content": "Rust development operates on a _train schedule_. That is, all development is\ndone in the main branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software\nrelease train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software\nprojects. There are three _release channels_ for Rust:\n\n- Nightly\n- Beta\n- Stable\n\nMost Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who want to\ntry out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how the development and release process works: let\u2019s\nassume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release\nhappened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version\nnumbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the main\nbranch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a\nrelease day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure\nautomatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - *\n```\n\nEvery six weeks, it\u2019s time to prepare a new release! The `beta` branch of the\nRust repository branches off from the main branch used by nightly. Now,\nthere are two releases:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                *\n```\n\nMost Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta in\ntheir CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions. In the meantime,\nthere\u2019s still a nightly release every night:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                *\n```\n\nLet\u2019s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the beta\nrelease before the regression snuck into a stable release! The fix is applied\nto the main branch, so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix is backported to\nthe `beta` branch, and a new release of beta is produced:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                * - - - - - - - - *\n```\n\nSix weeks after the first beta was created, it\u2019s time for a stable release! The\n`stable` branch is produced from the `beta` branch:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *\n                     |\nbeta:                * - - - - - - - - *\n                                       |\nstable:                                *\n```\n\nHooray! Rust 1.5 is done! However, we\u2019ve forgotten one thing: because the six\nweeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the _next_ version of Rust, 1.6.\nSo after `stable` branches off of `beta`, the next version of `beta` branches\noff of `nightly` again:\n\n```text\nnightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *\n                     |                         |\nbeta:                * - - - - - - - - *       *\n                                       |\nstable:                                *\n```\n\nThis is called the \u201ctrain model\u201d because every six weeks, a release \u201cleaves the\nstation\u201d, but still has to take a journey through the beta channel before it\narrives as a stable release.\n\nRust releases every six weeks, like clockwork. If you know the date of one Rust\nrelease, you can know the date of the next one: it\u2019s six weeks later. A nice\naspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is that the next train is\ncoming soon. If a feature happens to miss a particular release, there\u2019s no need\nto worry: another one is happening in a short time! This helps reduce pressure\nto sneak possibly unpolished features in close to the release deadline.\n\nThanks to this process, you can always check out the next build of Rust and\nverify for yourself that it\u2019s easy to upgrade to: if a beta release doesn\u2019t\nwork as expected, you can report it to the team and get it fixed before the\nnext stable release happens! Breakage in a beta release is relatively rare, but\n`rustc` is still a piece of software, and bugs do exist.",

    "content": "There\u2019s one more catch with this release model: unstable features. Rust uses a\ntechnique called \u201cfeature flags\u201d to determine what features are enabled in a\ngiven release. If a new feature is under active development, it lands on the\nmain branch, and therefore, in nightly, but behind a _feature flag_. If you, as\na user, wish to try out the work-in-progress feature, you can, but you must be\nusing a nightly release of Rust and annotate your source code with the\nappropriate flag to opt in.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a beta or stable release of Rust, you can\u2019t use any feature\nflags. This is the key that allows us to get practical use with new features\nbefore we declare them stable forever. Those who wish to opt into the bleeding\nedge can do so, and those who want a rock-solid experience can stick with\nstable and know that their code won\u2019t break. Stability without stagnation.\n\nThis book only contains information about stable features, as in-progress\nfeatures are still changing, and surely they\u2019ll be different between when this\nbook was written and when they get enabled in stable builds. You can find\ndocumentation for nightly-only features online.",

    "content": "Rustup makes it easy to change between different release channels of Rust, on a\nglobal or per-project basis. By default, you\u2019ll have stable Rust installed. To\ninstall nightly, for example:\n\n```console\n$ rustup toolchain install nightly\n```\n\nYou can see all of the _toolchains_ (releases of Rust and associated\ncomponents) you have installed with `rustup` as well. Here\u2019s an example on one\nof your authors\u2019 Windows computer:\n\n```powershell\n> rustup toolchain list\nstable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)\nbeta-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\nnightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\nAs you can see, the stable toolchain is the default. Most Rust users use stable\nmost of the time. You might want to use stable most of the time, but use\nnightly on a specific project, because you care about a cutting-edge feature.\nTo do so, you can use `rustup override` in that project\u2019s directory to set the\nnightly toolchain as the one `rustup` should use when you\u2019re in that directory:\n\n```console\n$ cd ~/projects/needs-nightly\n$ rustup override set nightly\n```\n\nNow, every time you call `rustc` or `cargo` inside of\n_~/projects/needs-nightly_, `rustup` will make sure that you are using nightly\nRust, rather than your default of stable Rust. This comes in handy when you\nhave a lot of Rust projects!",
