<h1>Catch-All Patterns and the `_` Placeholder</h1>
<p>Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but
for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game
where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move but instead
gets a fancy new hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all
other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s
a <code>match</code> that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll
hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by
functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for
this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-15-binding-catchall/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values <code>3</code> and <code>7</code>. For
the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the
variable we’ve chosen to name <code>other</code>. The code that runs for the <code>other</code> arm
uses the variable by passing it to the <code>move_player</code> function.</p>
<p>This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a
<code>u8</code> can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically
listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that <code>match</code> must be
exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the
patterns are evaluated in order. If we had put the catch-all arm earlier, the
other arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a
catch-all!</p>
<p>Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don’t want to
<em>use</em> the value in the catch-all pattern: <code>_</code> is a special pattern that matches
any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to
use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.</p>
<p>Let’s change the rules of the game: Now, if you roll anything other than a 3 or
a 7, you must roll again. We no longer need to use the catch-all value, so we
can change our code to use <code>_</code> instead of the variable named <code>other</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-16-underscore-catchall/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re explicitly
ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten anything.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll change the rules of the game one more time so that nothing else
happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can express
that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple
Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section) as the code that goes with the <code>_</code> arm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-17-underscore-unit/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other value
that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run any
code in this case.</p>
<p>There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in <a href="ch19-00-patterns.html">Chapter
19</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, we’re going to move on to the
<code>if let</code> syntax, which can be useful in situations where the <code>match</code> expression
is a bit wordy.</p>
