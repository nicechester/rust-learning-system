<h1>The Anatomy of a Rust Program</h1>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

}
</code></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: It
is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the
first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses (<code>()</code>).</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all
function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same
line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can
use an automatic formatter tool called <code>rustfmt</code> to format your code in a
particular style (more on <code>rustfmt</code> in
[Appendix D][devtools]<!-- ignore -->). The Rust team has included this tool
with the standard Rust distribution, as <code>rustc</code> is, so it should already be
installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function holds the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: It prints text to the
screen. There are three important details to notice here.</p>
<p>First, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it
would be entered as <code>println</code> (without the <code>!</code>). Rust macros are a way to write
code that generates code to extend Rust syntax, and we’ll discuss them in more
detail in [Chapter 20][ch20-macros]<!-- ignore -->. For now, you just need to
know that using a <code>!</code> means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal
function and that macros don’t always follow the same rules as functions.</p>
<p>Second, you see the <code>"Hello, world!"</code> string. We pass this string as an argument
to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed to the screen.</p>
<p>Third, we end the line with a semicolon (<code>;</code>), which indicates that this
expression is over, and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code
end with a semicolon.</p>
