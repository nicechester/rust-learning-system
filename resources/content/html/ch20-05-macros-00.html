<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Macros</h2>
<p>We’ve used macros like <code>println!</code> throughout this book, but we haven’t fully
explored what a macro is and how it works. The term <em>macro</em> refers to a family
of features in Rust—declarative macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> and three kinds of
procedural macros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom <code>#[derive]</code> macros that specify code added with the <code>derive</code> attribute
  used on structs and enums</li>
<li>Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item</li>
<li>Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens
  specified as their argument</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let’s look at why we even
need macros when we already have functions.</p>
