<h1>Raw Identifiers</h1>
<p><em>Raw identifiers</em> are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t
normally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with <code>r#</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>match</code> is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function
that uses <code>match</code> as its name:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<p>```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}</p>
<pre><code>
you’ll get this error:

```text
error: expected identifier, found keyword `match`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:4
  |
4 | fn match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword
</code></pre>
<p>The error shows that you can’t use the keyword <code>match</code> as the function
identifier. To use <code>match</code> as a function name, you need to use the raw
identifier syntax, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn r#match(needle: &amp;str, haystack: &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

fn main() {
    assert!(r#match(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;foobar&quot;));
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code will compile without any errors. Note the <code>r#</code> prefix on the function
name in its definition as well as where the function is called in <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if
that word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose
identifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a
language where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow
you to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses.
For example, <code>try</code> isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,
and 2024 editions. If you depend on a library that is written using the 2015
edition and has a <code>try</code> function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax,
<code>r#try</code> in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.
