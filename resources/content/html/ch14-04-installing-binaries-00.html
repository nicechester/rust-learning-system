<h2>Installing Binaries with <code>cargo install</code></h2>
<p>The <code>cargo install</code> command allows you to install and use binary crates
locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a
convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore -->. Note that you can only install
packages that have binary targets. A <em>binary target</em> is the runnable program
that is created if the crate has a <em>src/main.rs</em> file or another file specified
as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t runnable on its own but
is suitable for including within other programs. Usually, crates have
information in the README file about whether a crate is a library, has a
binary target, or both.</p>
<p>All binaries installed with <code>cargo install</code> are stored in the installation
root’s <em>bin</em> folder. If you installed Rust using <em>rustup.rs</em> and don’t have any
custom configurations, this directory will be <em>$HOME/.cargo/bin</em>. Ensure that
this directory is in your <code>$PATH</code> to be able to run programs you’ve installed
with <code>cargo install</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there’s a Rust implementation of
the <code>grep</code> tool called <code>ripgrep</code> for searching files. To install <code>ripgrep</code>, we
can run the following:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cargo install something you don't have, copy relevant output below
-->

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo install ripgrep
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded ripgrep v14.1.1
  Downloaded 1 crate (213.6 KB) in 0.40s
  Installing ripgrep v14.1.1
--snip--
   Compiling grep v0.3.2
    Finished `release` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.73s
  Installing ~/.cargo/bin/rg
   Installed package `ripgrep v14.1.1` (executable `rg`)
</code></pre>
<p>The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of the
installed binary, which in the case of <code>ripgrep</code> is <code>rg</code>. As long as the
installation directory is in your <code>$PATH</code>, as mentioned previously, you can
then run <code>rg --help</code> and start using a faster, Rustier tool for searching files!</p>
