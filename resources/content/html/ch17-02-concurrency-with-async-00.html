<h2>Applying Concurrency with Async</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll apply async to some of the same concurrency challenges
we tackled with threads in Chapter 16. Because we already talked about a lot of
the key ideas there, in this section we’ll focus on what’s different between
threads and futures.</p>
<p>In many cases, the APIs for working with concurrency using async are very
similar to those for using threads. In other cases, they end up being quite
different. Even when the APIs <em>look</em> similar between threads and async, they
often have different behavior—and they nearly always have different performance
characteristics.</p>
