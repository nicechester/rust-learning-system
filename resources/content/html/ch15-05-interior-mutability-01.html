<h1>Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime</h1>
<p>Unlike <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type represents single ownership over the data
it holds. So, what makes <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> different from a type like <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>?
Recall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> one mutable reference or any number
  of immutable references (but not both).</li>
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>With references and <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced at
compile time. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, these invariants are enforced <em>at runtime</em>.
With references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.</p>
<p>The advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors
will be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on
runtime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those
reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the
majority of cases, which is why this is Rust’s default.</p>
<p>The advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that
certain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, where they would’ve been
disallowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler,
is inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by
analyzing the code: The most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is
beyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.</p>
<p>Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can’t be sure the
code complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in
this way, it’s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users
wouldn’t be able to trust the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust rejects a
correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing
catastrophic can occur. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type is useful when you’re sure your
code follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and
guarantee that.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios
and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded
context. We’ll talk about how to get the functionality of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in a
multithreaded program in Chapter 16.</p>
<p>Here is a recap of the reasons to choose <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, or <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> enables multiple owners of the same data; <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
  have single owners.</li>
<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>
  allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows
  immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.</li>
<li>Because <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can
  mutate the value inside the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> even when the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is
  immutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the interior mutability
pattern. Let’s look at a situation in which interior mutability is useful and
examine how it’s possible.</p>
