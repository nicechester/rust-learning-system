<h1>Starting Relative Paths with `super`</h1>
<p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than
the current module or the crate root, by using <code>super</code> at the start of the
path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax that means
to go to the parent directory. Using <code>super</code> allows us to reference an item
that we know is in the parent module, which can make rearranging the module
tree easier when the module is closely related to the parent but the parent
might be moved elsewhere in the module tree someday.</p>
<p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef
fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The
function <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the
function <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to
<code>deliver_order</code>, starting with <code>super</code>.</p>

<p></Listing></p>
<p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can
use <code>super</code> to go to the parent module of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case
is <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it.
Success! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function
are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved
together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we
used <code>super</code> so that we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if
this code gets moved to a different module.</p>
