<h1>Saving the Argument Values in Variables</h1>
<p>The program is currently able to access the values specified as command line
arguments. Now we need to save the values of the two arguments in variables so
that we can use the values throughout the rest of the program. We do that in
Listing 12-2.</p>
<p><Listing number="12-2" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Creating variables to hold the query argument and file path argument"></p>
<p>```rust,should_panic,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-02/src/main.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

As we saw when we printed the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at `args[0]`, so we’re starting arguments at index 1. The
first argument `minigrep` takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable `query`. The second argument
will be the file path, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable `file_path`.

We temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the code is
working as we intend. Let’s run this program again with the arguments `test`
and `sample.txt`:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-02/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Great, the program is working! The values of the arguments we need are being
saved into the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal
with certain potential erroneous situations, such as when the user provides no
arguments; for now, we’ll ignore that situation and work on adding file-reading
capabilities instead.</p>
