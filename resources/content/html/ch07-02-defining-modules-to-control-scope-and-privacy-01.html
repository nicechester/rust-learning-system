<h1>Modules Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Before we get to the details of modules and paths, here we provide a quick
reference on how modules, paths, the <code>use</code> keyword, and the <code>pub</code> keyword work
in the compiler, and how most developers organize their code. We’ll be going
through examples of each of these rules throughout this chapter, but this is a
great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start from the crate root</strong>: When compiling a crate, the compiler first
  looks in the crate root file (usually <em>src/lib.rs</em> for a library crate and
  <em>src/main.rs</em> for a binary crate) for code to compile.</li>
<li><strong>Declaring modules</strong>: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules;
  say you declare a “garden” module with <code>mod garden;</code>. The compiler will look
  for the module’s code in these places:</li>
<li>Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following <code>mod
    garden</code></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/mod.rs</em></li>
<li><strong>Declaring submodules</strong>: In any file other than the crate root, you can
  declare submodules. For example, you might declare <code>mod vegetables;</code> in
  <em>src/garden.rs</em>. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the
  directory named for the parent module in these places:</li>
<li>Inline, directly following <code>mod vegetables</code>, within curly brackets instead
    of the semicolon</li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs</em></li>
<li><strong>Paths to code in modules</strong>: Once a module is part of your crate, you can
  refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long
  as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an
  <code>Asparagus</code> type in the garden vegetables module would be found at
  <code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Private vs. public</strong>: Code within a module is private from its parent
  modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with <code>pub mod</code>
  instead of <code>mod</code>. To make items within a public module public as well, use
  <code>pub</code> before their declarations.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>use</code> keyword</strong>: Within a scope, the <code>use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to
  items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to
  <code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>, you can create a shortcut with <code>use
  crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;</code>, and from then on you only need to
  write <code>Asparagus</code> to make use of that type in the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we create a binary crate named <code>backyard</code> that illustrates these rules.
The crate’s directory, also named <em>backyard</em>, contains these files and
directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The crate root file in this case is <em>src/main.rs</em>, and it contains:</p>
<p><Listing file-name="src/main.rs"></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/main.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

The `pub mod garden;` line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in
_src/garden.rs_, which is:

&lt;Listing file-name=&quot;src/garden.rs&quot;&gt;

```rust,noplayground,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/garden.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Here, <code>pub mod vegetables;</code> means the code in <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em> is
included too. That code is:</p>
<p><code>rust,noplayground,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/quick-reference-example/src/garden/vegetables.rs}}</code></p>
<p>Now let’s get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!</p>
