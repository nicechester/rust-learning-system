<h1>Accessing Fields of a Union</h1>
<p>The final action that works only with <code>unsafe</code> is accessing fields of a union.
A <em>union</em> is similar to a <code>struct</code>, but only one declared field is used in a
particular instance at one time. Unions are primarily used to interface with
unions in C code. Accessing union fields is unsafe because Rust can’t guarantee
the type of the data currently being stored in the union instance. You can
learn more about unions in [the Rust Reference][unions].</p>
