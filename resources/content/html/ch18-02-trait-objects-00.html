<h2>Using Trait Objects to Abstract over Shared Behavior</h2>
<p>In Chapter 8, we mentioned that one limitation of vectors is that they can
store elements of only one type. We created a workaround in Listing 8-9 where
we defined a <code>SpreadsheetCell</code> enum that had variants to hold integers, floats,
and text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and
still have a vector that represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good
solution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of types that we know
when our code is compiled.</p>
<p>However, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the set of
types that are valid in a particular situation. To show how we might achieve
this, we’ll create an example graphical user interface (GUI) tool that iterates
through a list of items, calling a <code>draw</code> method on each one to draw it to the
screen—a common technique for GUI tools. We’ll create a library crate called
<code>gui</code> that contains the structure of a GUI library. This crate might include
some types for people to use, such as <code>Button</code> or <code>TextField</code>. In addition,
<code>gui</code> users will want to create their own types that can be drawn: For
instance, one programmer might add an <code>Image</code>, and another might add a
<code>SelectBox</code>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the library, we can’t know and define all the types
other programmers might want to create. But we do know that <code>gui</code> needs to keep
track of many values of different types, and it needs to call a <code>draw</code> method
on each of these differently typed values. It doesn’t need to know exactly what
will happen when we call the <code>draw</code> method, just that the value will have that
method available for us to call.</p>
<p>To do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named
<code>Component</code> that has a method named <code>draw</code> on it. The other classes, such as
<code>Button</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>SelectBox</code>, would inherit from <code>Component</code> and thus
inherit the <code>draw</code> method. They could each override the <code>draw</code> method to define
their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if
they were <code>Component</code> instances and call <code>draw</code> on them. But because Rust
doesn’t have inheritance, we need another way to structure the <code>gui</code> library to
allow users to create new types compatible with the library.</p>
