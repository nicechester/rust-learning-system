<h1>Iterating Over the Values in a Vector</h1>
<p>To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all of the
elements rather than use indices to access one at a time. Listing 8-7 shows how
to use a <code>for</code> loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector of
<code>i32</code> values and print them.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-07/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>

<p>We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector
in order to make changes to all the elements. The <code>for</code> loop in Listing 8-8
will add <code>50</code> to each element.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the
<code>*</code> dereference operator to get to the value in <code>i</code> before we can use the <code>+=</code>
operator. We’ll talk more about the dereference operator in the [“Following the
Reference to the Value”][deref]<!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 15.</p>
<p>Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the
borrow checker’s rules. If we attempted to insert or remove items in the <code>for</code>
loop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would get a compiler error
similar to the one we got with the code in Listing 8-6. The reference to the
vector that the <code>for</code> loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the
whole vector.</p>
