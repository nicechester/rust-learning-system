<h1>Creating Different Types with Tuple Structs</h1>
<p>Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called <em>tuple structs</em>.
Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have
names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the
fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name
and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each
field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p>
<p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name
followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two
tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<p><Listing file-name="src/main.rs"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-01-tuple-structs/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types because they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For
example, a function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a
<code>Point</code> as an argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code>
values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can
destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a <code>.</code> followed
by the index to access an individual value. Unlike tuples, tuple structs
require you to name the type of the struct when you destructure them. For
example, we would write <code>let Point(x, y, z) = origin;</code> to destructure the
values in the <code>origin</code> point into variables named <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.</p>
