<h1>Importing Items with the Glob Operator</h1>
<p>If we want to bring <em>all</em> public items defined in a path into scope, we can
specify that path followed by the <code>*</code> glob operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::*;
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>use</code> statement brings all public items defined in <code>std::collections</code> into
the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it
harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program
was defined. Additionally, if the dependency changes its definitions, what
you’ve imported changes as well, which may lead to compiler errors when you
upgrade the dependency if the dependency adds a definition with the same name
as a definition of yours in the same scope, for example.</p>
<p>The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test into
the <code>tests</code> module; we’ll talk about that in <a href="ch11-01-writing-tests.html#how-to-write-tests">“How to Write
Tests”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 11. The glob operator is also
sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: See <a href="../std/prelude/index.html#other-preludes">the standard library
documentation</a><!-- ignore --> for more
information on that pattern.</p>
