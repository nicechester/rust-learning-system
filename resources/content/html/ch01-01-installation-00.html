<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, a
command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You’ll need
an internet connection for the download.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you prefer not to use <code>rustup</code> for some reason, please see the
[Other Rust Installation Methods page][otherinstall] for more options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that
compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might
differ slightly between versions because Rust often improves error messages and
warnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install using
these steps should work as expected with the content of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Command Line Notation</h3>
<p>In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with <code>$</code>. You
don’t need to type the <code>$</code> character; it’s the command line prompt shown to
indicate the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with <code>$</code> typically
show the output of the previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific
examples will use <code>&gt;</code> rather than <code>$</code>.</p>
