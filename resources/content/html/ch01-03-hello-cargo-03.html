<h1>Building for Release</h1>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build
--release</code> to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an
executable in <em>target/release</em> instead of <em>target/debug</em>. The optimizations
make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes
for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one
for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for
building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt
repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your
code’s running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with
the executable in <em>target/release</em>.</p>
