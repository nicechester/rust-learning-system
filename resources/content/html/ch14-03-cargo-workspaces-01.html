<h1>Creating a Workspace</h1>
<p>A <em>workspace</em> is a set of packages that share the same <em>Cargo.lock</em> and output
directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so
that we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple
ways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We’ll have a
workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide
the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will
provide an <code>add_one</code> function and the other library an <code>add_two</code> function.
These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating
a new directory for the workspace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ mkdir add
$ cd add
</code></pre>
<p>Next, in the <em>add</em> directory, we create the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that will
configure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a <code>[package]</code> section.
Instead, it will start with a <code>[workspace]</code> section that will allow us to add
members to the workspace. We also make a point to use the latest and greatest
version of Cargo’s resolver algorithm in our workspace by setting the
<code>resolver</code> value to <code>"3"</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">{{#include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/no-listing-01-workspace/add/Cargo.toml}}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll create the <code>adder</code> binary crate by running <code>cargo new</code> within the
<em>add</em> directory:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-01-adder-crate/add
remove `members = ["adder"]` from Cargo.toml
rm -rf adder
cargo new adder
copy output below
-->

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package
      Adding `adder` as member of workspace at `file:///projects/add`
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo new</code> inside a workspace also automatically adds the newly created
package to the <code>members</code> key in the <code>[workspace]</code> definition in the workspace
<em>Cargo.toml</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">{{#include ../listings/ch14-more-about-cargo/output-only-01-adder-crate/add/Cargo.toml}}
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we can build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code>. The files
in your <em>add</em> directory should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
</code></pre>
<p>The workspace has one <em>target</em> directory at the top level that the compiled
artifacts will be placed into; the <code>adder</code> package doesn’t have its own
<em>target</em> directory. Even if we were to run <code>cargo build</code> from inside the
<em>adder</em> directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in <em>add/target</em>
rather than <em>add/adder/target</em>. Cargo structures the <em>target</em> directory in a
workspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on
each other. If each crate had its own <em>target</em> directory, each crate would have
to recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts
in its own <em>target</em> directory. By sharing one <em>target</em> directory, the crates
can avoid unnecessary rebuilding.</p>
