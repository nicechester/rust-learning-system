<h1>Transferring Ownership Between Threads</h1>
<p>The <code>Send</code> marker trait indicates that ownership of values of the type
implementing <code>Send</code> can be transferred between threads. Almost every Rust type
implements <code>Send</code>, but there are some exceptions, including <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>: This
cannot implement <code>Send</code> because if you cloned an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value and tried to
transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both threads might update
the reference count at the same time. For this reason, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is implemented
for use in single-threaded situations where you don’t want to pay the
thread-safe performance penalty.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rust’s type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never
accidentally send an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value across threads unsafely. When we tried to do
this in Listing 16-14, we got the error <code>the trait `Send` is not implemented
for `Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;`</code>. When we switched to <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which does implement
<code>Send</code>, the code compiled.</p>
<p>Any type composed entirely of <code>Send</code> types is automatically marked as <code>Send</code> as
well. Almost all primitive types are <code>Send</code>, aside from raw pointers, which
we’ll discuss in Chapter 20.</p>
