<h1>Handling Potential Failure with `Result`</h1>
<p>We’re still working on this line of code. We’re now discussing a third line of
text, but note that it’s still part of a single logical line of code. The next
part is this method:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:expect}}</p>
<pre><code>
We could have written this code as:

```rust,ignore
io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess).expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. It’s
often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long
lines when you call a method with the <code>.method_name()</code> syntax. Now let’s
discuss what this line does.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string
we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. [<code>Result</code>][result]<!--
ignore --> is an [<em>enumeration</em>][enums]<!-- ignore -->, often called an <em>enum</em>,
which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each
possible state a <em>variant</em>.</p>
<p>[Chapter 6][enums]<!-- ignore --> will cover enums in more detail. The purpose
of these <code>Result</code> types is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>’s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the
operation was successful, and it contains the successfully generated value.
The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and it contains information
about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on
them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an [<code>expect</code> method][expect]<!-- ignore -->
that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code>
will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would
likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.
If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return
value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so that you can
use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.</p>
<p>If you don’t call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/no-listing-02-without-expect/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust warns that you haven’t used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>,
indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code,
but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we
can use <code>expect</code>. You’ll learn about recovering from errors in [Chapter
9][recover]<!-- ignore -->.</p>
