<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain <em>data type</em>, which tells Rust what kind of
data is being specified so that it knows how to work with that data. We’ll look
at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Rust is a <em>statically typed</em> language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases
when many types are possible, such as when we converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric
type using <code>parse</code> in the [“Comparing the Guess to the Secret
Number”][comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number]<!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let guess: u32 = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>If we don’t add the <code>: u32</code> type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust
will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more
information from us to know which type we want to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/output-only-01-no-type-annotations/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see different type annotations for other data types.</p>
