<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h1>Using Structs to Structure Related Data</h1>
<p>A <em>struct</em>, or <em>structure</em>, is a custom data type that lets you package
together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If
you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s
data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with
structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs are a
better way to group data.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to
define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions called
<em>methods</em>, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums
(discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your
program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile-time type checking.</p>
