<h1>Using Nested Paths to Clean Up `use` Lists</h1>
<p>If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing
each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our files. For
example, these two <code>use</code> statements we had in the guessing game in Listing 2-4
bring items from <code>std</code> into scope:</p>
<p><Listing file-name="src/main.rs"></p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/no-listing-01-use-std-unnested/src/main.rs:here}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one
line. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two
colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that
differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.

&lt;Listing number=&quot;7-18&quot; file-name=&quot;src/main.rs&quot; caption=&quot;Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same prefix into scope&quot;&gt;

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-18/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or
module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate <code>use</code> statements
needed by a lot!</p>
<p>We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining
two <code>use</code> statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two
<code>use</code> statements: one that brings <code>std::io</code> into scope and one that brings
<code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
<p><Listing number="7-19" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="Two <code>use</code> statements where one is a subpath of the other"></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-19/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

The common part of these two paths is `std::io`, and that’s the complete first
path. To merge these two paths into one `use` statement, we can use `self` in
the nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.

&lt;Listing number=&quot;7-20&quot; file-name=&quot;src/lib.rs&quot; caption=&quot;Combining the paths in Listing 7-19 into one `use` statement&quot;&gt;

```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-20/src/lib.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This line brings <code>std::io</code> and <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>
