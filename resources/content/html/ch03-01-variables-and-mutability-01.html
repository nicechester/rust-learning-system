<h1>Declaring Constants</h1>
<p>Like immutable variables, <em>constants</em> are values that are bound to a name and
are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants
and variables.</p>
<p>First, you aren’t allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants. Constants aren’t just
immutable by default—they’re always immutable. You declare constants using the
<code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value <em>must</em>
be annotated. We’ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,
[“Data Types”][data-types]<!-- ignore -->, so don’t worry about the details
right now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.</p>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes
them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.</p>
<p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,
not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a constant declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
</code></pre>
<p>The constant’s name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code>, and its value is set to the
result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number
of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with
underscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of
operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a
way that’s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant
to the value 10,800. See the [Rust Reference’s section on constant
evaluation][const-eval] for more information on what operations can be used
when declaring constants.</p>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in
which they were declared. This property makes constants useful for values in
your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to
earn, or the speed of light.</p>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in
conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also
helps to have only one place in your code that you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
