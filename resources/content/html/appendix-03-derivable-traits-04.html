<h1>`Clone` and `Copy` for Duplicating Values</h1>
<p>The <code>Clone</code> trait allows you to explicitly create a deep copy of a value, and
the duplication process might involve running arbitrary code and copying heap
data. See the [“Variables and Data Interacting with
Clone”][variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone]<!-- ignore --> section in
Chapter 4 for more information on <code>Clone</code>.</p>
<p>Deriving <code>Clone</code> implements the <code>clone</code> method, which when implemented for the
whole type, calls <code>clone</code> on each of the parts of the type. This means all the
fields or values in the type must also implement <code>Clone</code> to derive <code>Clone</code>.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Clone</code> is required is when calling the <code>to_vec</code> method on a
slice. The slice doesn’t own the type instances it contains, but the vector
returned from <code>to_vec</code> will need to own its instances, so <code>to_vec</code> calls
<code>clone</code> on each item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement <code>Clone</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits stored on
the stack; no arbitrary code is necessary. See the [“Stack-Only Data:
Copy”][stack-only-data-copy]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 for more
information on <code>Copy</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait doesn’t define any methods to prevent programmers from
overloading those methods and violating the assumption that no arbitrary code
is being run. That way, all programmers can assume that copying a value will be
very fast.</p>
<p>You can derive <code>Copy</code> on any type whose parts all implement <code>Copy</code>. A type that
implements <code>Copy</code> must also implement <code>Clone</code> because a type that implements
<code>Copy</code> has a trivial implementation of <code>Clone</code> that performs the same task as
<code>Copy</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait is rarely required; types that implement <code>Copy</code> have
optimizations available, meaning you don’t have to call <code>clone</code>, which makes
the code more concise.</p>
<p>Everything possible with <code>Copy</code> you can also accomplish with <code>Clone</code>, but the
code might be slower or have to use <code>clone</code> in places.</p>
