<h1>Showing Function Output</h1>
<p>By default, if a test passes, Rust’s test library captures anything printed to
standard output. For example, if we call <code>println!</code> in a test and the test
passes, we won’t see the <code>println!</code> output in the terminal; we’ll see only the
line that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we’ll see whatever was
printed to standard output with the rest of the failure message.</p>
<p>As an example, Listing 11-10 has a silly function that prints the value of its
parameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a test that fails.</p>
<p><Listing number="11-10" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="Tests for a function that calls <code>println!</code>"></p>
<p>```rust,panics,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-10/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

When we run these tests with `cargo test`, we’ll see the following output:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-10/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that nowhere in this output do we see <code>I got the value 4</code>, which is
printed when the test that passes runs. That output has been captured. The
output from the test that failed, <code>I got the value 8</code>, appears in the section
of the test summary output, which also shows the cause of the test failure.</p>
<p>If we want to see printed values for passing tests as well, we can tell Rust to
also show the output of successful tests with <code>--show-output</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo test -- --show-output
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the tests in Listing 11-10 again with the <code>--show-output</code> flag, we
see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/output-only-01-show-output/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
