<h1>Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing</h1>
<p><em>Inheritance</em> is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from
another object’s definition, thus gaining the parent object’s data and behavior
without you having to define them again.</p>
<p>If a language must have inheritance to be object oriented, then Rust is not
such a language. There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent
struct’s fields and method implementations without using a macro.</p>
<p>However, if you’re used to having inheritance in your programming toolbox, you
can use other solutions in Rust, depending on your reason for reaching for
inheritance in the first place.</p>
<p>You would choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code:
You can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables you
to reuse that implementation for a different type. You can do this in a limited
way in Rust code using default trait method implementations, which you saw in
Listing 10-14 when we added a default implementation of the <code>summarize</code> method
on the <code>Summary</code> trait. Any type implementing the <code>Summary</code> trait would have
the <code>summarize</code> method available on it without any further code. This is
similar to a parent class having an implementation of a method and an
inheriting child class also having the implementation of the method. We can
also override the default implementation of the <code>summarize</code> method when we
implement the <code>Summary</code> trait, which is similar to a child class overriding the
implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.</p>
<p>The other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to enable a
child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also
called <em>polymorphism</em>, which means that you can substitute multiple objects for
each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<p>To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it’s
actually a more general concept that refers to code that can work with data of
multiple types. For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses.</p>
<p>Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and
trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is
sometimes called <em>bounded parametric polymorphism</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust has chosen a different set of trade-offs by not offering inheritance.
Inheritance is often at risk of sharing more code than necessary. Subclasses
shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their parent class but will do so
with inheritance. This can make a program’s design less flexible. It also
introduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don’t make
sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t apply to the subclass. In
addition, some languages will only allow <em>single inheritance</em> (meaning a
subclass can only inherit from one class), further restricting the flexibility
of a program’s design.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust takes the different approach of using trait objects
instead of inheritance to achieve polymorphism at runtime. Let’s look at how
trait objects work.</p>
