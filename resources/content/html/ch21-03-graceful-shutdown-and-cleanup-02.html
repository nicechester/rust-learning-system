<h1>Signaling to the Threads to Stop Listening for Jobs</h1>
<p>With all the changes we’ve made, our code compiles without any warnings.
However, the bad news is that this code doesn’t function the way we want it to
yet. The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the <code>Worker</code>
instances: At the moment, we call <code>join</code>, but that won’t shut down the threads,
because they <code>loop</code> forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our
<code>ThreadPool</code> with our current implementation of <code>drop</code>, the main thread will
block forever, waiting for the first thread to finish.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, we’ll need a change in the <code>ThreadPool</code> <code>drop</code>
implementation and then a change in the <code>Worker</code> loop.</p>
<p>First, we’ll change the <code>ThreadPool</code> <code>drop</code> implementation to explicitly drop
the <code>sender</code> before waiting for the threads to finish. Listing 21-23 shows the
changes to <code>ThreadPool</code> to explicitly drop <code>sender</code>. Unlike with the thread,
here we <em>do</em> need to use an <code>Option</code> to be able to move <code>sender</code> out of
<code>ThreadPool</code> with <code>Option::take</code>.</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

Dropping `sender` closes the channel, which indicates no more messages will be
sent. When that happens, all the calls to `recv` that the `Worker` instances do
in the infinite loop will return an error. In Listing 21-24, we change the
`Worker` loop to gracefully exit the loop in that case, which means the threads
will finish when the `ThreadPool` `drop` implementation calls `join` on them.

<p>To see this code in action, let’s modify <code>main</code> to accept only two requests
before gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 21-25.</p>
<p><Listing number="21-25" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Shutting down the server after serving two requests by exiting the loop"></p>

<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

You wouldn’t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving only two
requests. This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is
in working order.

The `take` method is defined in the `Iterator` trait and limits the iteration
to the first two items at most. The `ThreadPool` will go out of scope at the
end of `main`, and the `drop` implementation will run.

Start the server with `cargo run` and make three requests. The third request
should error, and in your terminal, you should see output similar to this:

&lt;!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch21-web-server/listing-21-25
cargo run
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
curl http://127.0.0.1:7878
third request will error because server will have shut down
copy output below
Can't automate because the output depends on making requests
--&gt;

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s

Worker 2 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 3 disconnected; shutting down.
Worker 0 disconnected; shutting down.
Shutting down worker 1
Shutting down worker 2
Shutting down worker 3
</code></pre>
<p>You might see a different ordering of <code>Worker</code> IDs and messages printed. We can
see how this code works from the messages: <code>Worker</code> instances 0 and 3 got the
first two requests. The server stopped accepting connections after the second
connection, and the <code>Drop</code> implementation on <code>ThreadPool</code> starts executing
before <code>Worker 3</code> even starts its job. Dropping the <code>sender</code> disconnects all the
<code>Worker</code> instances and tells them to shut down. The <code>Worker</code> instances each
print a message when they disconnect, and then the thread pool calls <code>join</code> to
wait for each <code>Worker</code> thread to finish.</p>
<p>Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: The <code>ThreadPool</code>
dropped the <code>sender</code>, and before any <code>Worker</code> received an error, we tried to
join <code>Worker 0</code>. <code>Worker 0</code> had not yet gotten an error from <code>recv</code>, so the main
thread blocked, waiting for <code>Worker 0</code> to finish. In the meantime, <code>Worker 3</code>
received a job and then all threads received an error. When <code>Worker 0</code> finished,
the main thread waited for the rest of the <code>Worker</code> instances to finish. At that
point, they had all exited their loops and stopped.</p>
<p>Congrats! We’ve now completed our project; we have a basic web server that uses
a thread pool to respond asynchronously. We’re able to perform a graceful
shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.</p>

<p>We could do more here! If you want to continue enhancing this project, here are
some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more documentation to <code>ThreadPool</code> and its public methods.</li>
<li>Add tests of the library’s functionality.</li>
<li>Change calls to <code>unwrap</code> to more robust error handling.</li>
<li>Use <code>ThreadPool</code> to perform some task other than serving web requests.</li>
<li>Find a thread pool crate on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and implement a
  similar web server using the crate instead. Then, compare its API and
  robustness to the thread pool we implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Well done! You’ve made it to the end of the book! We want to thank you for
joining us on this tour of Rust. You’re now ready to implement your own Rust
projects and help with other people’s projects. Keep in mind that there is a
welcoming community of other Rustaceans who would love to help you with any
challenges you encounter on your Rust journey.</p>
