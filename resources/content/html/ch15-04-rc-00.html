<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the Reference-Counted Smart Pointer</h2>
<p>In the majority of cases, ownership is clear: You know exactly which variable
owns a given value. However, there are cases when a single value might have
multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might
point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges
that point to it. A node shouldn’t be cleaned up unless it doesn’t have any
edges pointing to it and so has no owners.</p>
<p>You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is an abbreviation for <em>reference counting</em>. The <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type
keeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not
the value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value
can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.</p>
<p>Imagine <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> as a TV in a family room. When one person enters to watch TV,
they turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the last
person leaves the room, they turn off the TV because it’s no longer being used.
If someone turns off the TV while others are still watching it, there would be
an uproar from the remaining TV watchers!</p>
<p>We use the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for
multiple parts of our program to read and we can’t determine at compile time
which part will finish using the data last. If we knew which part would finish
last, we could just make that part the data’s owner, and the normal ownership
rules enforced at compile time would take effect.</p>
<p>Note that <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we discuss
concurrency in Chapter 16, we’ll cover how to do reference counting in
multithreaded programs.</p>
