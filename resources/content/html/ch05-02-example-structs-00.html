<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>An Example Program Using Structs</h2>
<p>To understand when we might want to use structs, let’s write a program that
calculates the area of a rectangle. We’ll start by using single variables and
then refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new binary project with Cargo called <em>rectangles</em> that will take
the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area
of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
exactly that in our project’s <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><Listing number="5-8" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Calculating the area of a rectangle specified by separate width and height variables"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/src/main.rs:all}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Now, run this program using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the
<code>area</code> function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code clear
and readable.</p>
<p>The issue with this code is evident in the signature of <code>area</code>:</p>
<p><code>rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-08/src/main.rs:here}}</code></p>
<p>The <code>area</code> function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the
function we wrote has two parameters, and it’s not clear anywhere in our
program that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more
manageable to group width and height together. We’ve already discussed one way
we might do that in [“The Tuple Type”][the-tuple-type]<!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3: by using tuples.</p>
