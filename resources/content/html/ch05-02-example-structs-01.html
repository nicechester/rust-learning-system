<h1>Refactoring with Tuples</h1>
<p>Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.</p>
<p><Listing number="5-9" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Specifying the width and height of the rectangle with a tuple"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-09/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and
we’re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less
clear: Tuples don’t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of
the tuple, making our calculation less obvious.</p>
<p>Mixing up the width and height wouldn’t matter for the area calculation, but if
we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have to
keep in mind that <code>width</code> is the tuple index <code>0</code> and <code>height</code> is the tuple
index <code>1</code>. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in
mind if they were to use our code. Because we haven’t conveyed the meaning of
our data in our code, it’s now easier to introduce errors.</p>
