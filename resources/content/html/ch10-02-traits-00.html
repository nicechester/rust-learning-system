<h2>Defining Shared Behavior with Traits</h2>
<p>A <em>trait</em> defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with
other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We
can use <em>trait bounds</em> to specify that a generic type can be any type that has
certain behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called <em>interfaces</em> in other
languages, although with some differences.</p>
