<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<p>The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is <code>true</code> and the
ability to run some code repeatedly while a condition is <code>true</code> are basic
building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that
let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are <code>if</code> expressions and
loops.</p>
