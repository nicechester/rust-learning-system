<h1>Using Text Editors and IDEs</h1>
<p>This book makes no assumptions about what tools you use to author Rust code.
Just about any text editor will get the job done! However, many text editors and
integrated development environments (IDEs) have built-in support for Rust. You
can always find a fairly current list of many editors and IDEs on [the tools
page][tools] on the Rust website.</p>
