<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave <em>comments</em> in
their source code that the compiler will ignore but that people reading the
source code may find useful.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the
comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend beyond a
single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what's going on.
</code></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-24-comments-end-of-line/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-25-comments-above-line/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html">“Publishing a Crate to Crates.io”</a><!-- ignore -->
section of Chapter 14.</p>
