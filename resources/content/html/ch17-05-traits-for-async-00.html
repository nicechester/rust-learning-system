<h2>A Closer Look at the Traits for Async</h2>
<p>Throughout the chapter, we’ve used the <code>Future</code>, <code>Stream</code>, and <code>StreamExt</code>
traits in various ways. So far, though, we’ve avoided getting too far into the
details of how they work or how they fit together, which is fine most of the
time for your day-to-day Rust work. Sometimes, though, you’ll encounter
situations where you’ll need to understand a few more of these traits’ details,
along with the <code>Pin</code> type and the <code>Unpin</code> trait. In this section, we’ll dig in
just enough to help in those scenarios, still leaving the <em>really</em> deep dive
for other documentation.</p>
