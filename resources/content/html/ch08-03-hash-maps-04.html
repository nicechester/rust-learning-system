<h1>Updating a Hash Map</h1>
<p>Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key can
only have one value associated with it at a time (but not vice versa: For
example, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have the value <code>10</code>
stored in the <code>scores</code> hash map).</p>
<p>When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to
handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the
old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could
keep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the
key <em>doesn’t</em> already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the
new value. Let’s look at how to do each of these!</p>
<h4>Overwriting a Value</h4>
<p>If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key
with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.
Even though the code in Listing 8-23 calls <code>insert</code> twice, the hash map will
only contain one key-value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue
team’s key both times.</p>

</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This code will print <code>{"Blue": 25}</code>. The original value of <code>10</code> has been
overwritten.</p>

<h4>Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn’t Present</h4>
<p>It’s common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash map
with a value and then to take the following actions: If the key does exist in
the hash map, the existing value should remain the way it is; if the key
doesn’t exist, insert it and a value for it.</p>
<p>Hash maps have a special API for this called <code>entry</code> that takes the key you
want to check as a parameter. The return value of the <code>entry</code> method is an enum
called <code>Entry</code> that represents a value that might or might not exist. Let’s say
we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated
with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value <code>50</code>, and the same for the
Blue team. Using the <code>entry</code> API, the code looks like Listing 8-24.</p>
<p><Listing number="8-24" caption="Using the <code>entry</code> method to only insert if the key does not already have a value"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-24/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>The <code>or_insert</code> method on <code>Entry</code> is defined to return a mutable reference to
the value for the corresponding <code>Entry</code> key if that key exists, and if not, it
inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable
reference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the
logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.</p>
<p>Running the code in Listing 8-24 will print <code>{"Yellow": 50, "Blue": 10}</code>. The
first call to <code>entry</code> will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value
<code>50</code> because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to
<code>entry</code> will not change the hash map, because the Blue team already has the
value <code>10</code>.</p>
<h4>Updating a Value Based on the Old Value</h4>
<p>Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then
update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that
counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with
the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve
seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert
the value <code>0</code>.</p>
<p><Listing number="8-25" caption="Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-25/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This code will print <code>{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}</code>. You might see
the same key-value pairs printed in a different order: Recall from [“Accessing
Values in a Hash Map”][access]<!-- ignore --> that iterating over a hash map
happens in an arbitrary order.</p>
<p>The <code>split_whitespace</code> method returns an iterator over subslices, separated by
whitespace, of the value in <code>text</code>. The <code>or_insert</code> method returns a mutable
reference (<code>&amp;mut V</code>) to the value for the specified key. Here, we store that
mutable reference in the <code>count</code> variable, so in order to assign to that value,
we must first dereference <code>count</code> using the asterisk (<code>*</code>). The mutable
reference goes out of scope at the end of the <code>for</code> loop, so all of these
changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.</p>
