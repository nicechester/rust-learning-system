<h1>Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate</h1>
<p>When you’ve made changes to your crate and are ready to release a new version,
you change the <code>version</code> value specified in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and
republish. Use the [Semantic Versioning rules][semver] to decide what an
appropriate next version number is, based on the kinds of changes you’ve made.
Then, run <code>cargo publish</code> to upload the new version.</p>
