<h1>Printing Errors to Standard Error</h1>
<p>We’ll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are printed.
Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all the code that
prints error messages is in one function, <code>main</code>. The standard library provides
the <code>eprintln!</code> macro that prints to the standard error stream, so let’s change
the two places we were calling <code>println!</code> to print errors to use <code>eprintln!</code>
instead.</p>
<p><Listing number="12-24" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Writing error messages to standard error instead of standard output using <code>eprintln!</code>"></p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-24/src/main.rs:here}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

Let’s now run the program again in the same way, without any arguments and
redirecting standard output with `&gt;`:

```console
$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Now we see the error onscreen and <em>output.txt</em> contains nothing, which is the
behavior we expect of command line programs.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error but still
redirect standard output to a file, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- to poem.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We won’t see any output to the terminal, and <em>output.txt</em> will contain our
results:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: output.txt</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates that we’re now using standard output for successful output
and standard error for error output as appropriate.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter recapped some of the major concepts you’ve learned so far and
covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust. By using command line
arguments, files, environment variables, and the <code>eprintln!</code> macro for printing
errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. Combined with
the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well organized, store data
effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors nicely, and be
well tested.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll explore some Rust features that were influenced by functional
languages: closures and iterators.</p>
