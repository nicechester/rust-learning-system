<h1>Variable Scope</h1>
<p>Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the <code>fn main() {</code>
code in the examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the
following examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples
will be a bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the scope of some variables. A
<em>scope</em> is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current scope. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p>
<p><Listing number="4-1" caption="A variable and the scope in which it is valid"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-01/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into</em> scope, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of</em> scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
