<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously</h2>
<p>In most current operating systems, an executed program’s code is run in a
<em>process</em>, and the operating system will manage multiple processes at once.
Within a program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously.
The features that run these independent parts are called <em>threads</em>. For
example, a web server could have multiple threads so that it can respond to
more than one request at the same time.</p>
<p>Splitting the computation in your program into multiple threads to run multiple
tasks at the same time can improve performance, but it also adds complexity.
Because threads can run simultaneously, there’s no inherent guarantee about the
order in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead
to problems, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions, in which threads are accessing data or resources in an
  inconsistent order</li>
<li>Deadlocks, in which two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both
  threads from continuing</li>
<li>Bugs that only happen in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix
  reliably</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust attempts to mitigate the negative effects of using threads, but
programming in a multithreaded context still takes careful thought and requires
a code structure that is different from that in programs running in a single
thread.</p>
<p>Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and many
operating systems provide an API the programming language can call for creating
new threads. The Rust standard library uses a <em>1:1</em> model of thread
implementation, whereby a program uses one operating system thread per one
language thread. There are crates that implement other models of threading that
make different trade-offs to the 1:1 model. (Rust’s async system, which we will
see in the next chapter, provides another approach to concurrency as well.)</p>
