<h1>In Enum Definitions</h1>
<p>As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their
variants. Let’s take another look at the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum that the standard
library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This definition should now make more sense to you. As you can see, the
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is generic over type <code>T</code> and has two variants: <code>Some</code>, which
holds one value of type <code>T</code>, and a <code>None</code> variant that doesn’t hold any value.
By using the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum, we can express the abstract concept of an
optional value, and because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is generic, we can use this abstraction
no matter what the type of the optional value is.</p>
<p>Enums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the <code>Result</code>
enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Result</code> enum is generic over two types, <code>T</code> and <code>E</code>, and has two variants:
<code>Ok</code>, which holds a value of type <code>T</code>, and <code>Err</code>, which holds a value of type
<code>E</code>. This definition makes it convenient to use the <code>Result</code> enum anywhere we
have an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type <code>T</code>) or fail
(return an error of some type <code>E</code>). In fact, this is what we used to open a
file in Listing 9-3, where <code>T</code> was filled in with the type <code>std::fs::File</code> when
the file was opened successfully and <code>E</code> was filled in with the type
<code>std::io::Error</code> when there were problems opening the file.</p>
<p>When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum
definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can
avoid duplication by using generic types instead.</p>
