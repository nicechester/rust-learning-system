<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the <code>fn</code> keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.</p>
<p>Rust code uses <em>snake case</em> as the conventional style for function and variable
names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-16-functions/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p>We define a function in Rust by entering <code>fn</code> followed by a function name and a
set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function
body begins and ends.</p>
<p>We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set
of parentheses. Because <code>another_function</code> is defined in the program, it can be
called from inside the <code>main</code> function. Note that we defined <code>another_function</code>
<em>after</em> the <code>main</code> function in the source code; we could have defined it before
as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re
defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.</p>
<p>Let’s start a new binary project named <em>functions</em> to explore functions
further. Place the <code>another_function</code> example in <em>src/main.rs</em> and run it. You
should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-16-functions/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the <code>main</code> function.
First the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then <code>another_function</code> is called
and its message is printed.</p>
