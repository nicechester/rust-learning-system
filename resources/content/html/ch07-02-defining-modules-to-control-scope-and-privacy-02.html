<h1>Grouping Related Code in Modules</h1>
<p><em>Modules</em> let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.
Modules also allow us to control the <em>privacy</em> of items because code within a
module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details
not available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items
within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend
on them.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s write a library crate that provides the functionality of a
restaurant. We’ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies
empty to concentrate on the organization of the code rather than the
implementation of a restaurant.</p>
<p>In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as front
of house and others as back of house. <em>Front of house</em> is where customers are;
this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take orders and
payment, and bartenders make drinks. <em>Back of house</em> is where the chefs and
cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do administrative
work.</p>
<p>To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested
modules. Create a new library named <code>restaurant</code> by running <code>cargo new
restaurant --lib</code>. Then, enter the code in Listing 7-1 into <em>src/lib.rs</em> to
define some modules and function signatures; this code is the front of house
section.</p>
<p><Listing number="7-1" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="A <code>front_of_house</code> module containing other modules that then contain functions"></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch07-managing-growing-projects/listing-07-01/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

We define a module with the `mod` keyword followed by the name of the module
(in this case, `front_of_house`). The body of the module then goes inside curly
brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the
modules `hosting` and `serving`. Modules can also hold definitions for other
items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and as in Listing 7-1,
functions.

By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why
they’re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on the
groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier
to find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality
to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.

Earlier, we mentioned that _src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ are called _crate
roots_. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two
files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate’s module structure,
known as the _module tree_.

Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

&lt;Listing number=&quot;7-2&quot; caption=&quot;The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1&quot;&gt;

```text
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside other modules; for example,
<code>hosting</code> nests inside <code>front_of_house</code>. The tree also shows that some modules
are <em>siblings</em>, meaning they’re defined in the same module; <code>hosting</code> and
<code>serving</code> are siblings defined within <code>front_of_house</code>. If module A is
contained inside module B, we say that module A is the <em>child</em> of module B and
that module B is the <em>parent</em> of module A. Notice that the entire module tree
is rooted under the implicit module named <code>crate</code>.</p>
<p>The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your
computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem,
you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we
need a way to find our modules.</p>
