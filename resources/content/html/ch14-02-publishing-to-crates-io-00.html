<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Publishing a Crate to Crates.io</h2>
<p>We’ve used packages from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> as
dependencies of our project, but you can also share your code with other people
by publishing your own packages. The crate registry at
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> distributes the source code of
your packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.</p>
<p>Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people
to find and use. We’ll talk about some of these features next and then explain
how to publish a package.</p>
