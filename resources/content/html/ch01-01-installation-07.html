<h1>Working Offline with This Book</h1>
<p>In several examples, we will use Rust packages beyond the standard library. To
work through those examples, you will either need to have an internet connection
or to have downloaded those dependencies ahead of time. To download the
dependencies ahead of time, you can run the following commands. (We’ll explain
what <code>cargo</code> is and what each of these commands does in detail later.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new get-dependencies
$ cd get-dependencies
$ cargo add rand@0.8.5 trpl@0.2.0
</code></pre>
<p>This will cache the downloads for these packages so you will not need to
download them later. Once you have run this command, you do not need to keep the
<code>get-dependencies</code> folder. If you have run this command, you can use the
<code>--offline</code> flag with all <code>cargo</code> commands in the rest of the book to use these
cached versions instead of attempting to use the network.</p>
