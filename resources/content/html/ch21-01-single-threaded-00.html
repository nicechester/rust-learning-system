<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Building a Single-Threaded Web Server</h2>
<p>We’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin,
let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web
servers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but
a brief overview will give you the information you need.</p>
<p>The two main protocols involved in web servers are <em>Hypertext Transfer
Protocol</em> <em>(HTTP)</em> and <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> <em>(TCP)</em>. Both protocols
are <em>request-response</em> protocols, meaning a <em>client</em> initiates requests and a
<em>server</em> listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The
contents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.</p>
<p>TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information
gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that information is.
HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and
responses. It’s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in
the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We’ll work with the
raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.</p>
