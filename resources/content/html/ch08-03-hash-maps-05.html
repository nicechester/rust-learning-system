<h1>Hashing Functions</h1>
<p>By default, <code>HashMap</code> uses a hashing function called <em>SipHash</em> that can provide
resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving hash
tables<a href="[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash)">^siphash</a><!-- ignore -->. This is not the fastest hashing algorithm
available, but the trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in
performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default
hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function
by specifying a different hasher. A <em>hasher</em> is a type that implements the
<code>BuildHasher</code> trait. We’ll talk about traits and how to implement them in
<a href="ch10-02-traits.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore -->. You don’t necessarily have to implement
your own hasher from scratch; <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore -->
has libraries shared by other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many
common hashing algorithms.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of functionality
necessary in programs when you need to store, access, and modify data. Here are
some exercises you should now be equipped to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted,
   the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most
   often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.</li>
<li>Convert strings to Pig Latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to
   the end of the word and <em>ay</em> is added, so <em>first</em> becomes <em>irst-fay</em>. Words
   that start with a vowel have <em>hay</em> added to the end instead (<em>apple</em> becomes
   <em>apple-hay</em>). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!</li>
<li>Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add
   employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to
   Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then, let the user retrieve a list of
   all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted
   alphabetically.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors, strings,
and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!</p>
<p>We’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail, so it’s
a perfect time to discuss error handling. We’ll do that next!</p>
