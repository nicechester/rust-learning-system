<h2>How to Write Tests</h2>
<p><em>Tests</em> are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up any needed data or state.</li>
<li>Run the code you want to test.</li>
<li>Assert that the results are what you expect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that
take these actions, which include the <code>test</code> attribute, a few macros, and the
<code>should_panic</code> attribute.</p>
