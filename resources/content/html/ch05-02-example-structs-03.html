<h1>Adding Functionality with Derived Traits</h1>
<p>It’d be useful to be able to print an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> while we’re
debugging our program and see the values for all its fields. Listing 5-11 tries
using the <a href="../std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code> macro</a><!-- ignore --> as we have used in
previous chapters. This won’t work, however.</p>
<p><Listing number="5-11" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Attempting to print a <code>Rectangle</code> instance"></p>
<p>```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-11/src/main.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:

```text
{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-11/output.txt:3}}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>println!</code> macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly
brackets tell <code>println!</code> to use formatting known as <code>Display</code>: output intended
for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we’ve seen so far
implement <code>Display</code> by default because there’s only one way you’d want to show
a <code>1</code> or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way
<code>println!</code> should format the output is less clear because there are more
display possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the
curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust
doesn’t try to guess what we want, and structs don’t have a provided
implementation of <code>Display</code> to use with <code>println!</code> and the <code>{}</code> placeholder.</p>
<p>If we continue reading the errors, we’ll find this helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-11/output.txt:9:10}}
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s try it! The <code>println!</code> macro call will now look like <code>println!("rect1 is
{rect1:?}");</code>. Putting the specifier <code>:?</code> inside the curly brackets tells
<code>println!</code> we want to use an output format called <code>Debug</code>. The <code>Debug</code> trait
enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so that
we can see its value while we’re debugging our code.</p>
<p>Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-01-debug/output.txt:3}}
</code></pre>
<p>But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-01-debug/output.txt:9:10}}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust <em>does</em> include functionality to print out debugging information, but we
have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct.
To do that, we add the outer attribute <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> just before the
struct definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.</p>
<p><Listing number="5-12" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Adding the attribute to derive the <code>Debug</code> trait and printing the <code>Rectangle</code> instance using debug formatting"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-12/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Now when we run the program, we won’t get any errors, and we’ll see the
following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-12/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Nice! It’s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields
for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have
larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in
those cases, we can use <code>{:#?}</code> instead of <code>{:?}</code> in the <code>println!</code> string. In
this example, using the <code>{:#?}</code> style will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/output-only-02-pretty-debug/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to print out a value using the <code>Debug</code> format is to use the <a href="../std/macro.dbg.html"><code>dbg!</code>
macro</a><!-- ignore -->, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed
to <code>println!</code>, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of
where that <code>dbg!</code> macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value
of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Calling the <code>dbg!</code> macro prints to the standard error console stream
(<code>stderr</code>), as opposed to <code>println!</code>, which prints to the standard output
console stream (<code>stdout</code>). We’ll talk more about <code>stderr</code> and <code>stdout</code> in the
<a href="ch12-06-writing-to-stderr-instead-of-stdout.html">“Redirecting Errors to Standard Error” section in Chapter
12</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example where we’re interested in the value that gets assigned to the
<code>width</code> field, as well as the value of the whole struct in <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-05-dbg-macro/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p>We can put <code>dbg!</code> around the expression <code>30 * scale</code> and, because <code>dbg!</code>
returns ownership of the expression’s value, the <code>width</code> field will get the
same value as if we didn’t have the <code>dbg!</code> call there. We don’t want <code>dbg!</code> to
take ownership of <code>rect1</code>, so we use a reference to <code>rect1</code> in the next call.
Here’s what the output of this example looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-05-dbg-macro/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the first bit of output came from <em>src/main.rs</em> line 10 where we’re
debugging the expression <code>30 * scale</code>, and its resultant value is <code>60</code> (the
<code>Debug</code> formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The
<code>dbg!</code> call on line 14 of <em>src/main.rs</em> outputs the value of <code>&amp;rect1</code>, which is
the <code>Rectangle</code> struct. This output uses the pretty <code>Debug</code> formatting of the
<code>Rectangle</code> type. The <code>dbg!</code> macro can be really helpful when you’re trying to
figure out what your code is doing!</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>Debug</code> trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us
to use with the <code>derive</code> attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom
types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.md">Appendix C</a><!--
ignore -->. We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as
well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many
attributes other than <code>derive</code>; for more information, see <a href="../reference/attributes.html">the “Attributes”
section of the Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is very specific: It only computes the area of rectangles.
It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our <code>Rectangle</code> struct
because it won’t work with any other type. Let’s look at how we can continue to
refactor this code by turning the <code>area</code> function into an <code>area</code> method
defined on our <code>Rectangle</code> type.</p>
