<h1>Relationships</h1>
<p>The way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your
function is doing. For example, if we changed the implementation of the
<code>longest</code> function to always return the first parameter rather than the longest
string slice, we wouldn’t need to specify a lifetime on the <code>y</code> parameter. The
following code will compile:</p>
<p><Listing file-name="src/main.rs"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-08-only-one-reference-with-lifetime/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>We’ve specified a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> for the parameter <code>x</code> and the return
type, but not for the parameter <code>y</code>, because the lifetime of <code>y</code> does not have
any relationship with the lifetime of <code>x</code> or the return value.</p>
<p>When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the
return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If
the reference returned does <em>not</em> refer to one of the parameters, it must refer
to a value created within this function. However, this would be a dangling
reference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function.
Consider this attempted implementation of the <code>longest</code> function that won’t
compile:</p>
<p><Listing file-name="src/main.rs"></p>
<p>```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-09-unrelated-lifetime/src/main.rs:here}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

Here, even though we’ve specified a lifetime parameter `'a` for the return
type, this implementation will fail to compile because the return value
lifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameters at all. Here is the
error message we get:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/no-listing-09-unrelated-lifetime/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <code>result</code> goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end
of the <code>longest</code> function. We’re also trying to return a reference to <code>result</code>
from the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that
would change the dangling reference, and Rust won’t let us create a dangling
reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type
rather than a reference so that the calling function is then responsible for
cleaning up the value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various
parameters and return values of functions. Once they’re connected, Rust has
enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that
would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.</p>
