<h1>Using External Packages</h1>
<p>In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external
package called <code>rand</code> to get random numbers. To use <code>rand</code> in our project, we
added this line to <em>Cargo.toml</em>:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:
* ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.md
* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md
-->

<p><Listing file-name="Cargo.toml"></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/Cargo.toml:9:}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Adding <code>rand</code> as a dependency in <em>Cargo.toml</em> tells Cargo to download the
<code>rand</code> package and any dependencies from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and
make <code>rand</code> available to our project.</p>
<p>Then, to bring <code>rand</code> definitions into the scope of our package, we added a
<code>use</code> line starting with the name of the crate, <code>rand</code>, and listed the items we
wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in [“Generating a Random
Number”][rand]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 2, we brought the <code>Rng</code> trait into
scope and called the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-03/src/main.rs:ch07-04}}</p>
<pre><code>
Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
[crates.io](https://crates.io/), and pulling any of them into your package
involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s _Cargo.toml_ file and
using `use` to bring items from their crates into scope.

Note that the standard `std` library is also a crate that’s external to our
package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we
don’t need to change _Cargo.toml_ to include `std`. But we do need to refer to
it with `use` to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example,
with `HashMap` we would use this line:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
</code></pre>
<p>This is an absolute path starting with <code>std</code>, the name of the standard library
crate.</p>
