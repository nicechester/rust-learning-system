<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes
no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so
if you prefer to use an IDE instead of the command line, feel free to use your
favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s
documentation for details. The Rust team has been focusing on enabling great
IDE support via <code>rust-analyzer</code>. See [Appendix D][devtools]<!-- ignore -->
for more details.</p>
