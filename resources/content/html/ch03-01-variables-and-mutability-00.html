<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Variables and Mutability</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the [“Storing Values with
Variables”][storing-values-with-variables]<!-- ignore --> section, by default,
variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write
your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that
Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.
Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why
sometimes you might want to opt out.</p>
<p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change
that value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called <em>variables</em> in
your <em>projects</em> directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in your new <em>variables</em> directory, open <em>src/main.rs</em> and replace its
code with the following code, which won’t compile just yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<p>```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-01-variables-are-immutable/src/main.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
Save and run the program using `cargo run`. You should receive an error message
regarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-01-variables-are-immutable/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.
Compiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program
isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do <em>not</em> mean that you’re
not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p>
<p>You received the error message <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`</code> because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable.</p>
<p>It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that’s designated as immutable, because this very situation can lead to
bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will
never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible
that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do. The cause
of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only <em>sometimes</em>. The Rust
compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t change, it really
won’t change, so you don’t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus
easier to reason through.</p>
<p>But mutability can be very useful and can make code more convenient to write.
Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by
adding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in [Chapter
2][storing-values-with-variables]<!-- ignore -->. Adding <code>mut</code> also conveys
intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code
will be changing this variable’s value.</p>
<p>For example, let’s change <em>src/main.rs</em> to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-02-adding-mut/src/main.rs}}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the program now, we get this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-02-adding-mut/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>We’re allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> when <code>mut</code> is
used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and
depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</p>
