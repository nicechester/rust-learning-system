<h1>Choosing Between Loops and Iterators</h1>
<p>The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own code and
why: the original implementation in Listing 13-21 or the version using
iterators in Listing 13-22 (assuming we’re collecting all the results before
returning them rather than returning the iterator). Most Rust programmers
prefer to use the iterator style. It’s a bit tougher to get the hang of at
first, but once you get a feel for the various iterator adapters and what they
do, iterators can be easier to understand. Instead of fiddling with the various
bits of looping and building new vectors, the code focuses on the high-level
objective of the loop. This abstracts away some of the commonplace code so that
it’s easier to see the concepts that are unique to this code, such as the
filtering condition each element in the iterator must pass.</p>
<p>But are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assumption
might be that the lower-level loop will be faster. Let’s talk about performance.</p>
