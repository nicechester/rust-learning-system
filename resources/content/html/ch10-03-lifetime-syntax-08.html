<h1>Lifetime Elision</h1>
<p>You’ve learned that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify
lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use references. However, we
had a function in Listing 4-9, shown again in Listing 10-25, that compiled
without lifetime annotations.</p>
<p><Listing number="10-25" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="A function we defined in Listing 4-9 that compiled without lifetime annotations, even though the parameter and return type are references"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-25/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical:
In early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn’t have compiled, because
every reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function
signature would have been written like this:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {</p>
<pre><code>
After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers
were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular
situations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic
patterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler’s code so
that the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and
wouldn’t need explicit annotations.

This piece of Rust history is relevant because it’s possible that more
deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,
even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.

The patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references are called the
_lifetime elision rules_. These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; they’re
a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code
fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.

The elision rules don’t provide full inference. If there is still ambiguity
about what lifetimes the references have after Rust applies the rules, the
compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be.
Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve
by adding the lifetime annotations.

Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called _input lifetimes_, and
lifetimes on return values are called _output lifetimes_.

The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references
when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input
lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the
compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for
which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.
These rules apply to `fn` definitions as well as `impl` blocks.

The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each
parameter that’s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter
gets one lifetime parameter: `fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)`; a function with two
parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: `fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32,
y: &amp;'b i32)`; and so on.

The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that
lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)
-&gt; &amp;'a i32`.

The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but
one of them is `&amp;self` or `&amp;mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of
`self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes
methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.

Let’s pretend we’re the compiler. We’ll apply these rules to figure out the
lifetimes of the references in the signature of the `first_word` function in
Listing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the
references:

```rust,ignore
fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter
gets its own lifetime. We’ll call it <code>'a</code> as usual, so now the signature is
this:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;str {</p>
<pre><code>
The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second
rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to
the output lifetime, so the signature is now this:

```rust,ignore
fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the
compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate
the lifetimes in this function signature.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example, this time using the <code>longest</code> function that had
no lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</p>
<pre><code>
Let’s apply the first rule: Each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we
have two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:

```rust,ignore
fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the second rule doesn’t apply, because there is more than one
input lifetime. The third rule doesn’t apply either, because <code>longest</code> is a
function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>. After
working through all three rules, we still haven’t figured out what the return
type’s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in
Listing 10-20: The compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still
couldn’t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p>
<p>Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we’ll look at
lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don’t have to
annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p>
