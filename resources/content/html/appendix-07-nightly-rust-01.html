<h1>Stability Without Stagnation</h1>
<p>As a language, Rust cares a <em>lot</em> about the stability of your code. We want
Rust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things were
constantly changing, that would be impossible. At the same time, if we can’t
experiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until after
their release, when we can no longer change things.</p>
<p>Our solution to this problem is what we call “stability without stagnation”,
and our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading to a
new version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should also
bring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster compile times.</p>
