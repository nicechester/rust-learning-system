<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps</h2>
<p>The last of our common collections is the hash map. The type <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>
stores a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code> using a <em>hashing
function</em>, which determines how it places these keys and values into memory.
Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often
use a different name, such as <em>hash</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>object</em>, <em>hash table</em>,
<em>dictionary</em>, or <em>associative array</em>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as
you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example,
in a game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map in which
each key is a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team
name, you can retrieve its score.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies
are hiding in the functions defined on <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> by the standard library.
As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.</p>
