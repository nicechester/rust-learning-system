<h1>Creating a Project with Cargo</h1>
<p>Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our
original “Hello, world!” project. Navigate back to your <em>projects</em> directory
(or wherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system,
run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
</code></pre>
<p>The first command creates a new directory and project called <em>hello_cargo</em>.
We’ve named our project <em>hello_cargo</em>, and Cargo creates its files in a
directory of the same name.</p>
<p>Go into the <em>hello_cargo</em> directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo
has generated two files and one directory for us: a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and a
<em>src</em> directory with a <em>main.rs</em> file inside.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <em>.gitignore</em> file.
Git files won’t be generated if you run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git
repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change <code>cargo new</code> to
use a different version control system or no version control system by using
the <code>--vcs</code> flag. Run <code>cargo new --help</code> to see the available options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the
code in Listing 1-2.</p>
<p><Listing number="1-2" file-name="Cargo.toml" caption="Contents of *Cargo.toml* generated by <code>cargo new</code>"></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_cargo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2024&quot;

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This file is in the [<em>TOML</em>][toml]<!-- ignore --> (<em>Tom’s Obvious, Minimal
Language</em>) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the
following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to
this file, we’ll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile
your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We’ll talk
about the <code>edition</code> key in [Appendix E][appendix-e]<!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any
of your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as
<em>crates</em>. We won’t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the
first project in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Now open <em>src/main.rs</em> and take a look:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one we
wrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the
project Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the <em>src</em> directory,
and we have a <em>Cargo.toml</em> configuration file in the top directory.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <em>src</em> directory. The
top-level project directory is just for README files, license information,
configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo
helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and
everything is in its place.</p>
<p>If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello,
world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the
project code into the <em>src</em> directory and create an appropriate <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file. One easy way to get that <em>Cargo.toml</em> file is to run <code>cargo init</code>, which
will create it for you automatically.</p>
