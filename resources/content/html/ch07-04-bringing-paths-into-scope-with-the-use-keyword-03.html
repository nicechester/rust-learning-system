<h1>Re-exporting Names with `pub use`</h1>
<p>When we bring a name into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword, the name is private to
the scope into which we imported it. To enable code outside that scope to refer
to that name as if it had been defined in that scope, we can combine <code>pub</code> and
<code>use</code>. This technique is called <em>re-exporting</em> because we’re bringing an item
into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into their
scope.</p>
<p>Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with <code>use</code> in the root module
changed to <code>pub use</code>.</p>

<p>Before this change, external code would have to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
function by using the path
<code>restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code>, which also would have
required the <code>front_of_house</code> module to be marked as <code>pub</code>. Now that this <code>pub
use</code> has re-exported the <code>hosting</code> module from the root module, external code
can use the path <code>restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different
from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For
example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think
about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant
probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With <code>pub
use</code>, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure.
Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library
and programmers calling the library. We’ll look at another example of <code>pub use</code>
and how it affects your crate’s documentation in [“Exporting a Convenient Public
API”][ch14-pub-use]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 14.</p>
