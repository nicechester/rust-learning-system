<h1>Choo, Choo! Release Channels and Riding the Trains</h1>
<p>Rust development operates on a <em>train schedule</em>. That is, all development is
done in the main branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software
release train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software
projects. There are three <em>release channels</em> for Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nightly</li>
<li>Beta</li>
<li>Stable</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who want to
try out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how the development and release process works: let’s
assume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release
happened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version
numbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the main
branch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a
release day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure
automatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - *
</code></pre>
<p>Every six weeks, it’s time to prepare a new release! The <code>beta</code> branch of the
Rust repository branches off from the main branch used by nightly. Now,
there are two releases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *
</code></pre>
<p>Most Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta in
their CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions. In the meantime,
there’s still a nightly release every night:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                *
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the beta
release before the regression snuck into a stable release! The fix is applied
to the main branch, so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix is backported to
the <code>beta</code> branch, and a new release of beta is produced:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - *
                     |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *
</code></pre>
<p>Six weeks after the first beta was created, it’s time for a stable release! The
<code>stable</code> branch is produced from the <code>beta</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *
                     |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *
                                       |
stable:                                *
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! Rust 1.5 is done! However, we’ve forgotten one thing: because the six
weeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the <em>next</em> version of Rust, 1.6.
So after <code>stable</code> branches off of <code>beta</code>, the next version of <code>beta</code> branches
off of <code>nightly</code> again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - * - * - *
                     |                         |
beta:                * - - - - - - - - *       *
                                       |
stable:                                *
</code></pre>
<p>This is called the “train model” because every six weeks, a release “leaves the
station”, but still has to take a journey through the beta channel before it
arrives as a stable release.</p>
<p>Rust releases every six weeks, like clockwork. If you know the date of one Rust
release, you can know the date of the next one: it’s six weeks later. A nice
aspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is that the next train is
coming soon. If a feature happens to miss a particular release, there’s no need
to worry: another one is happening in a short time! This helps reduce pressure
to sneak possibly unpolished features in close to the release deadline.</p>
<p>Thanks to this process, you can always check out the next build of Rust and
verify for yourself that it’s easy to upgrade to: if a beta release doesn’t
work as expected, you can report it to the team and get it fixed before the
next stable release happens! Breakage in a beta release is relatively rare, but
<code>rustc</code> is still a piece of software, and bugs do exist.</p>
