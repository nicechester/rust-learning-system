<h1>Methods That Consume the Iterator</h1>
<p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait has a number of different methods with default
implementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these
methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the <code>Iterator</code>
trait. Some of these methods call the <code>next</code> method in their definition, which
is why you’re required to implement the <code>next</code> method when implementing the
<code>Iterator</code> trait.</p>
<p>Methods that call <code>next</code> are called <em>consuming adapters</em> because calling them
uses up the iterator. One example is the <code>sum</code> method, which takes ownership of
the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling <code>next</code>, thus
consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running
total and returns the total when iteration is complete. Listing 13-13 has a
test illustrating a use of the <code>sum</code> method.</p>

<p>We aren’t allowed to use <code>v1_iter</code> after the call to <code>sum</code>, because <code>sum</code> takes
ownership of the iterator we call it on.</p>
