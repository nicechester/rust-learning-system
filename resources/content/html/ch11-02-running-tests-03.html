<h1>Running a Subset of Tests by Name</h1>
<p>Running a full test suite can sometimes take a long time. If you’re working on
code in a particular area, you might want to run only the tests pertaining to
that code. You can choose which tests to run by passing <code>cargo test</code> the name
or names of the test(s) you want to run as an argument.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how to run a subset of tests, we’ll first create three tests for
our <code>add_two</code> function, as shown in Listing 11-11, and choose which ones to run.</p>
<p><Listing number="11-11" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="Three tests with three different names"></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-11/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

If we run the tests without passing any arguments, as we saw earlier, all the
tests will run in parallel:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/listing-11-11/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<h4>Running Single Tests</h4>
<p>We can pass the name of any test function to <code>cargo test</code> to run only that test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/output-only-02-single-test/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>Only the test with the name <code>one_hundred</code> ran; the other two tests didn’t match
that name. The test output lets us know we had more tests that didn’t run by
displaying <code>2 filtered out</code> at the end.</p>
<p>We can’t specify the names of multiple tests in this way; only the first value
given to <code>cargo test</code> will be used. But there is a way to run multiple tests.</p>
<h4>Filtering to Run Multiple Tests</h4>
<p>We can specify part of a test name, and any test whose name matches that value
will be run. For example, because two of our tests’ names contain <code>add</code>, we can
run those two by running <code>cargo test add</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/output-only-03-multiple-tests/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>This command ran all tests with <code>add</code> in the name and filtered out the test
named <code>one_hundred</code>. Also note that the module in which a test appears becomes
part of the test’s name, so we can run all the tests in a module by filtering
on the module’s name.</p>
