<h1>Adding Custom Failure Messages</h1>
<p>You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as
optional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any
arguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the
<code>format!</code> macro (discussed in [“Concatenating with <code>+</code> or
<code>format!</code>”][concatenating]<!--
ignore --> in Chapter 8), so you can pass a format string that contains <code>{}</code>
placeholders and values to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful
for documenting what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better
idea of what the problem is with the code.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and we
want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-05-greeter/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re
pretty sure the `Hello` text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We
decided we don’t want to have to update the test when the requirements change,
so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the
`greeting` function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of the
input parameter.

Now let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing `greeting` to exclude
`name` to see what the default test failure looks like:

```rust,not_desired_behavior,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-06-greeter-with-bug/src/lib.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this test produces the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-06-greeter-with-bug/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>This result just indicates that the assertion failed and which line the
assertion is on. A more useful failure message would print the value from the
<code>greeting</code> function. Let’s add a custom failure message composed of a format
string with a placeholder filled in with the actual value we got from the
<code>greeting</code> function:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-07-custom-failure-message/src/lib.rs:here}}</p>
<pre><code>
Now when we run the test, we’ll get a more informative error message:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-07-custom-failure-message/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the value we actually got in the test output, which would help us
debug what happened instead of what we were expecting to happen.</p>
