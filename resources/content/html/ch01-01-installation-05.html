<h1>Reading the Local Documentation</h1>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so
that you can read it offline. Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation
in your browser.</p>
<p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not
sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface
(API) documentation to find out!</p>
