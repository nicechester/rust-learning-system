<h2>Extensible Concurrency with <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code></h2>
<p>Interestingly, almost every concurrency feature we’ve talked about so far in
this chapter has been part of the standard library, not the language. Your
options for handling concurrency are not limited to the language or the
standard library; you can write your own concurrency features or use those
written by others.</p>
<p>However, among the key concurrency concepts that are embedded in the language
rather than the standard library are the <code>std::marker</code> traits <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>.</p>
