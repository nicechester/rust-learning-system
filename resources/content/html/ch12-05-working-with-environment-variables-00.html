<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Working with Environment Variables</h2>
<p>We’ll improve the <code>minigrep</code> binary by adding an extra feature: an option for
case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment
variable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that
users enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead making it an
environment variable, we allow our users to set the environment variable once
and have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.</p>
