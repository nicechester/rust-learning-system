<h1>Managing Ownership in Hash Maps</h1>
<p>For types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, like <code>i32</code>, the values are copied
into the hash map. For owned values like <code>String</code>, the values will be moved and
the hash map will be the owner of those values, as demonstrated in Listing 8-22.</p>
<p><Listing number="8-22" caption="Showing that keys and values are owned by the hash map once they’re inserted"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch08-common-collections/listing-08-22/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>We aren’t able to use the variables <code>field_name</code> and <code>field_value</code> after
they’ve been moved into the hash map with the call to <code>insert</code>.</p>
<p>If we insert references to values into the hash map, the values won’t be moved
into the hash map. The values that the references point to must be valid for at
least as long as the hash map is valid. We’ll talk more about these issues in
[“Validating References with
Lifetimes”][validating-references-with-lifetimes]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 10.</p>
