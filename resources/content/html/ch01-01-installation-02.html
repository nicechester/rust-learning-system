<h1>Installing `rustup` on Windows</h1>
<p>On Windows, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][install]<!-- ignore
--> and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the
installation, you’ll be prompted to install Visual Studio. This provides a
linker and the native libraries needed to compile programs. If you need more
help with this step, see
[https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html][msvc]<!--
ignore -->.</p>
<p>The rest of this book uses commands that work in both <em>cmd.exe</em> and PowerShell.
If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.</p>
