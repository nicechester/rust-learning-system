<h1>Using Unsafe Code Correctly</h1>
<p>Using <code>unsafe</code> to use one of the five superpowers just discussed isn’t wrong or
even frowned upon, but it is trickier to get <code>unsafe</code> code correct because the
compiler can’t help uphold memory safety. When you have a reason to use
<code>unsafe</code> code, you can do so, and having the explicit <code>unsafe</code> annotation makes
it easier to track down the source of problems when they occur. Whenever you
write unsafe code, you can use Miri to help you be more confident that the code
you have written upholds Rust’s rules.</p>
<p>For a much deeper exploration of how to work effectively with unsafe Rust, read
Rust’s official guide for <code>unsafe</code>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/">The Rustonomicon</a>.</p>
