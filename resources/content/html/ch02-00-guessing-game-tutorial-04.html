<h1>Printing Values with `println!` Placeholders</h1>
<p>Aside from the closing curly bracket, there’s only one more line to discuss in
the code so far:</p>
<p>```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:print_guess}}</p>
<pre><code>
This line prints the string that now contains the user’s input. The `{}` set of
curly brackets is a placeholder: Think of `{}` as little crab pincers that hold
a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can
go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an
expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the
format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty
curly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result
of an expression in one call to `println!` would look like this:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!(&quot;x = {x} and y + 2 = {}&quot;, y + 2);
</code></pre>
<p>This code would print <code>x = 5 and y + 2 = 12</code>.</p>
