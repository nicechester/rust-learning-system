<h1>Ignoring Tests Unless Specifically Requested</h1>
<p>Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute, so you
might want to exclude them during most runs of <code>cargo test</code>. Rather than
listing as arguments all tests you do want to run, you can instead annotate the
time-consuming tests using the <code>ignore</code> attribute to exclude them, as shown
here:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-11-ignore-a-test/src/lib.rs:here}}</p>
<pre><code>
After `#[test]`, we add the `#[ignore]` line to the test we want to exclude.
Now when we run our tests, `it_works` runs, but `expensive_test` doesn’t:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/no-listing-11-ignore-a-test/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>expensive_test</code> function is listed as <code>ignored</code>. If we want to run only
the ignored tests, we can use <code>cargo test -- --ignored</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch11-writing-automated-tests/output-only-04-running-ignored/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>By controlling which tests run, you can make sure your <code>cargo test</code> results
will be returned quickly. When you’re at a point where it makes sense to check
the results of the <code>ignored</code> tests and you have time to wait for the results,
you can run <code>cargo test -- --ignored</code> instead. If you want to run all tests
whether they’re ignored or not, you can run <code>cargo test -- --include-ignored</code>.</p>
