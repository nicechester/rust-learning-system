<h1>Compilation and Execution</h1>
<p>You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the
process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by
entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing it the name of your source file, like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to <code>gcc</code>
or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by
entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ls
main  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll
see the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD on Windows, you
would enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <em>.rs</em> extension, the executable file
(<em>main.exe</em> on Windows, but <em>main</em> on all other platforms), and, when using
Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <em>.pdb</em> extension.
From here, you run the <em>main</em> or <em>main.exe</em> file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./main # or .\main on Windows
</code></pre>
<p>If your <em>main.rs</em> is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints <code>Hello,
world!</code> to your terminal.</p>
<p>If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or
JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as
separate steps. Rust is an <em>ahead-of-time compiled</em> language, meaning you can
compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it
even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a <em>.rb</em>, <em>.py</em>, or
<em>.js</em> file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation
installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to
compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your
code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.</p>
