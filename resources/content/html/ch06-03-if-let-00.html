<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Concise Control Flow with <code>if let</code> and <code>let...else</code></h2>
<p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the
program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value in the
<code>config_max</code> variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the <code>Some</code>
variant.</p>
<p><Listing number="6-6" caption="A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing code when the value is <code>Some</code>"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-06/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>If the value is <code>Some</code>, we print out the value in the <code>Some</code> variant by binding
the value to the variable <code>max</code> in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything
with the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we have to add <code>_ =&gt;
()</code> after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to
add.</p>
<p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following
code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in Listing 6-6:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-12-if-let/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax <code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a <code>match</code>, where the expression is given to the
<code>match</code> and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is
<code>Some(max)</code>, and the <code>max</code> binds to the value inside the <code>Some</code>. We can then
use <code>max</code> in the body of the <code>if let</code> block in the same way we used <code>max</code> in
the corresponding <code>match</code> arm. The code in the <code>if let</code> block only runs if the
value matches the pattern.</p>
<p>Using <code>if let</code> means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking <code>match</code> enforces that ensures that
you aren’t forgetting to handle any cases. Choosing between <code>match</code> and <code>if
let</code> depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether
gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.</p>
<p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the
<code>else</code> is the same as the block of code that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the
<code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall the
<code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a
<code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code>
expression, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-13-count-and-announce-match/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p>Or we could use an <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code> expression, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/no-listing-14-count-and-announce-if-let-else/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<h2>Staying on the “Happy Path” with <code>let...else</code></h2>
<p>The common pattern is to perform some computation when a value is present and
return a default value otherwise. Continuing with our example of coins with a
<code>UsState</code> value, if we wanted to say something funny depending on how old the
state on the quarter was, we might introduce a method on <code>UsState</code> to check the
age of a state, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-07/src/main.rs:state}}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we might use <code>if let</code> to match on the type of coin, introducing a <code>state</code>
variable within the body of the condition, as in Listing 6-7.</p>
<p><Listing number="6-7" caption="Checking whether a state existed in 1900 by using conditionals nested inside an <code>if let</code>"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-07/src/main.rs:describe}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>That gets the job done, but it has pushed the work into the body of the <code>if
let</code> statement, and if the work to be done is more complicated, it might be
hard to follow exactly how the top-level branches relate. We could also take
advantage of the fact that expressions produce a value either to produce the
<code>state</code> from the <code>if let</code> or to return early, as in Listing 6-8. (You could do
something similar with a <code>match</code>, too.)</p>
<p><Listing number="6-8" caption="Using <code>if let</code> to produce a value or return early"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-08/src/main.rs:describe}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>This is a bit annoying to follow in its own way, though! One branch of the <code>if
let</code> produces a value, and the other one returns from the function entirely.</p>
<p>To make this common pattern nicer to express, Rust has <code>let...else</code>. The
<code>let...else</code> syntax takes a pattern on the left side and an expression on the
right, very similar to <code>if let</code>, but it does not have an <code>if</code> branch, only an
<code>else</code> branch. If the pattern matches, it will bind the value from the pattern
in the outer scope. If the pattern does <em>not</em> match, the program will flow into
the <code>else</code> arm, which must return from the function.</p>
<p>In Listing 6-9, you can see how Listing 6-8 looks when using <code>let...else</code> in
place of <code>if let</code>.</p>
<p><Listing number="6-9" caption="Using <code>let...else</code> to clarify the flow through the function"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch06-enums-and-pattern-matching/listing-06-09/src/main.rs:describe}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>Notice that it stays on the “happy path” in the main body of the function this
way, without having significantly different control flow for two branches the
way the <code>if let</code> did.</p>
<p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a <code>match</code>, remember that <code>if let</code> and <code>let...else</code> are in your
Rust toolbox as well.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.</p>
<p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: The
compiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each
function expects.</p>
<p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.</p>
