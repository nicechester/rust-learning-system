<h1>`PartialEq` and `Eq` for Equality Comparisons</h1>
<p>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait allows you to compare instances of a type to check for
equality and enables use of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.</p>
<p>Deriving <code>PartialEq</code> implements the <code>eq</code> method. When <code>PartialEq</code> is derived on
structs, two instances are equal only if <em>all</em> fields are equal, and the
instances are not equal if <em>any</em> fields are not equal. When derived on enums,
each variant is equal to itself and not equal to the other variants.</p>
<p>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait is required, for example, with the use of the
<code>assert_eq!</code> macro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a type
for equality.</p>
<p>The <code>Eq</code> trait has no methods. Its purpose is to signal that for every value of
the annotated type, the value is equal to itself. The <code>Eq</code> trait can only be
applied to types that also implement <code>PartialEq</code>, although not all types that
implement <code>PartialEq</code> can implement <code>Eq</code>. One example of this is floating-point
number types: The implementation of floating-point numbers states that two
instances of the not-a-number (<code>NaN</code>) value are not equal to each other.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Eq</code> is required is for keys in a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> so that
the <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> can tell whether two keys are the same.</p>
