<h1>Leveraging Cargo’s Conventions</h1>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using
<code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it’s much easier to
let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real
tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any
existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code
using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ git clone example.org/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about Cargo, check out <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you
learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code>.</li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version.</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation.</li>
<li>Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using <code>rustc</code> directly.</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading
and writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we’ll build a guessing game program.
If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in
Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>
