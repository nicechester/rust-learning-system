<h1>Installing `rustup` on Linux or macOS</h1>
<p>If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the <code>rustup</code>
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rust is installed now. Great!
</code></pre>
<p>You will also need a <em>linker</em>, which is a program that Rust uses to join its
compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get
linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a
linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on
C code and will need a C compiler.</p>
<p>On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<p>Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
the <code>build-essential</code> package.</p>
