<h1>Rustup and the Role of Rust Nightly</h1>
<p>Rustup makes it easy to change between different release channels of Rust, on a
global or per-project basis. By default, you’ll have stable Rust installed. To
install nightly, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup toolchain install nightly
</code></pre>
<p>You can see all of the <em>toolchains</em> (releases of Rust and associated
components) you have installed with <code>rustup</code> as well. Here’s an example on one
of your authors’ Windows computer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)
beta-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the stable toolchain is the default. Most Rust users use stable
most of the time. You might want to use stable most of the time, but use
nightly on a specific project, because you care about a cutting-edge feature.
To do so, you can use <code>rustup override</code> in that project’s directory to set the
nightly toolchain as the one <code>rustup</code> should use when you’re in that directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cd ~/projects/needs-nightly
$ rustup override set nightly
</code></pre>
<p>Now, every time you call <code>rustc</code> or <code>cargo</code> inside of
<em>~/projects/needs-nightly</em>, <code>rustup</code> will make sure that you are using nightly
Rust, rather than your default of stable Rust. This comes in handy when you
have a lot of Rust projects!</p>
