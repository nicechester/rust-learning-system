<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Accepting Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>Let’s create a new project with, as always, <code>cargo new</code>. We’ll call our project
<code>minigrep</code> to distinguish it from the <code>grep</code> tool that you might already have
on your system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
</code></pre>
<p>The first task is to make <code>minigrep</code> accept its two command line arguments: the
file path and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our
program with <code>cargo run</code>, two hyphens to indicate the following arguments are
for our program rather than for <code>cargo</code>, a string to search for, and a path to
a file to search in, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, the program generated by <code>cargo new</code> cannot process arguments we
give it. Some existing libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> can help
with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but because you’re
just learning this concept, let’s implement this capability ourselves.</p>
