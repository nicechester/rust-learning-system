<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h1>Enums and Pattern Matching</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at enumerations, also referred to as <em>enums</em>.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then, we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the <code>if let</code>
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in
your code.</p>
