<h1>`match` Arms</h1>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of <code>match</code> expressions.
Formally, <code>match</code> expressions are defined as the keyword <code>match</code>, a value to
match on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an
expression to run if the value matches that arm’s pattern, like this:</p>
<!--

<pre><code>match <em>VALUE</em> {
    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,
    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,
    <em>PATTERN</em> => <em>EXPRESSION</em>,
}</code></pre>

<p>For example, here’s the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 6-5 that matches on an
<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> value in the variable <code>x</code>:</p>
<p><code>rust,ignore
match x {
    None =&gt; None,
    Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
}</code></p>
<p>The patterns in this <code>match</code> expression are the <code>None</code> and <code>Some(i)</code> to the
left of each arrow.</p>
<p>One requirement for <code>match</code> expressions is that they need to be exhaustive in
the sense that all possibilities for the value in the <code>match</code> expression must
be accounted for. One way to ensure that you’ve covered every possibility is to
have a catch-all pattern for the last arm: For example, a variable name
matching any value can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.</p>
<p>The particular pattern <code>_</code> will match anything, but it never binds to a
variable, so it’s often used in the last match arm. The <code>_</code> pattern can be
useful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We’ll
cover the <code>_</code> pattern in more detail in [“Ignoring Values in a
Pattern”][ignoring-values-in-a-pattern]<!-- ignore --> later in this chapter.</p>
