<h2>Adding Functionality with Test-Driven Development</h2>
<p>Now that we have the search logic in <em>src/lib.rs</em> separate from the <code>main</code>
function, it’s much easier to write tests for the core functionality of our
code. We can call functions directly with various arguments and check return
values without having to call our binary from the command line.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the <code>minigrep</code> program using
the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you
   expect.</li>
<li>Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.</li>
<li>Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue
   to pass.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 1!</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it’s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code
design. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass
helps maintain high test coverage throughout the process.</p>
<p>We’ll test-drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do
the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of
lines that match the query. We’ll add this functionality in a function called
<code>search</code>.</p>
