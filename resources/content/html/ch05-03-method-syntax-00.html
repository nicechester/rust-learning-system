<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Methods are similar to functions: We declare them with the <code>fn</code> keyword and a
name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code
that’s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions,
methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait
object, which we cover in [Chapter 6][enums]<!-- ignore --> and [Chapter
18][trait-objects]<!-- ignore -->, respectively), and their first parameter is
always <code>self</code>, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being
called on.</p>
