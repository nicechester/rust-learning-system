<h1>Testing the First Part</h1>
<p>Let’s test the first part of the guessing game. Run it using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/
cargo clean
cargo run
input 6 -->

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.44s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
Please input your guess.
6
You guessed: 6
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the first part of the game is done: We’re getting input from the
keyboard and then printing it.</p>
<h2>Generating a Secret Number</h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The
secret number should be different every time so that the game is fun to play
more than once. We’ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so that the game
isn’t too difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in
its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a [<code>rand</code>
crate][randcrate] with said functionality.</p>
