<h1>Objects Contain Data and Behavior</h1>
<p>The book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em> by
Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Addison-Wesley,
1994), colloquially referred to as <em>The Gang of Four</em> book, is a catalog of
object-oriented design patterns. It defines OOP in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An <strong>object</strong> packages both
data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are
typically called <strong>methods</strong> or <strong>operations</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this definition, Rust is object oriented: Structs and enums have data,
and <code>impl</code> blocks provide methods on structs and enums. Even though structs and
enums with methods aren’t <em>called</em> objects, they provide the same
functionality, according to the Gang of Four’s definition of objects.</p>
