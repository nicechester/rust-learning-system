<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Appendix C: Derivable Traits</h2>
<p>In various places in the book, we’ve discussed the <code>derive</code> attribute, which
you can apply to a struct or enum definition. The <code>derive</code> attribute generates
code that will implement a trait with its own default implementation on the
type you’ve annotated with the <code>derive</code> syntax.</p>
<p>In this appendix, we provide a reference of all the traits in the standard
library that you can use with <code>derive</code>. Each section covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What operators and methods deriving this trait will enable</li>
<li>What the implementation of the trait provided by <code>derive</code> does</li>
<li>What implementing the trait signifies about the type</li>
<li>The conditions in which you’re allowed or not allowed to implement the trait</li>
<li>Examples of operations that require the trait</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want different behavior from that provided by the <code>derive</code> attribute,
consult the <a href="../std/index.html">standard library documentation</a><!-- ignore -->
for each trait for details on how to manually implement them.</p>
<p>The traits listed here are the only ones defined by the standard library that
can be implemented on your types using <code>derive</code>. Other traits defined in the
standard library don’t have sensible default behavior, so it’s up to you to
implement them in the way that makes sense for what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>An example of a trait that can’t be derived is <code>Display</code>, which handles
formatting for end users. You should always consider the appropriate way to
display a type to an end user. What parts of the type should an end user be
allowed to see? What parts would they find relevant? What format of the data
would be most relevant to them? The Rust compiler doesn’t have this insight, so
it can’t provide appropriate default behavior for you.</p>
<p>The list of derivable traits provided in this appendix is not comprehensive:
Libraries can implement <code>derive</code> for their own traits, making the list of
traits you can use <code>derive</code> with truly open ended. Implementing <code>derive</code>
involves using a procedural macro, which is covered in the [“Custom <code>derive</code>
Macros”][custom-derive-macros]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 20.</p>
