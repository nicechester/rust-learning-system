<h1>Publishing to Crates.io</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve created an account, saved your API token, chosen a name for
your crate, and specified the required metadata, you’re ready to publish!
Publishing a crate uploads a specific version to
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> for others to use.</p>
<p>Be careful, because a publish is <em>permanent</em>. The version can never be
overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted except in certain circumstances.
One major goal of Crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of code so that
builds of all projects that depend on crates from
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> will continue to work. Allowing
version deletions would make fulfilling that goal impossible. However, there is
no limit to the number of crate versions you can publish.</p>
<p>Run the <code>cargo publish</code> command again. It should succeed now:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
go to some valid crate, publish a new version
cargo publish
copy just the relevant lines below
-->

<p>Congratulations! You’ve now shared your code with the Rust community, and
anyone can easily add your crate as a dependency of their project.</p>
