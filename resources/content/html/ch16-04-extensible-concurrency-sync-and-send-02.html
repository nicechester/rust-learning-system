<h1>Accessing from Multiple Threads</h1>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing
<code>Sync</code> to be referenced from multiple threads. In other words, any type <code>T</code>
implements <code>Sync</code> if <code>&amp;T</code> (an immutable reference to <code>T</code>) implements <code>Send</code>,
meaning the reference can be sent safely to another thread. Similar to <code>Send</code>,
primitive types all implement <code>Sync</code>, and types composed entirely of types that
implement <code>Sync</code> also implement <code>Sync</code>.</p>
<p>The smart pointer <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> also doesn’t implement <code>Sync</code> for the same reasons
that it doesn’t implement <code>Send</code>. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type (which we talked about
in Chapter 15) and the family of related <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> types don’t implement
<code>Sync</code>. The implementation of borrow checking that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> does at runtime
is not thread-safe. The smart pointer <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> implements <code>Sync</code> and can be
used to share access with multiple threads, as you saw in [“Shared Access to
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>”][shared-access]<!-- ignore -->.</p>
