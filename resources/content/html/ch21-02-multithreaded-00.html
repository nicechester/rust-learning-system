<h2>From a Single-Threaded to a Multithreaded Server</h2>
<p>Right now, the server will process each request in turn, meaning it won’t
process a second connection until the first connection is finished processing.
If the server received more and more requests, this serial execution would be
less and less optimal. If the server receives a request that takes a long time
to process, subsequent requests will have to wait until the long request is
finished, even if the new requests can be processed quickly. We’ll need to fix
this, but first we’ll look at the problem in action.</p>
