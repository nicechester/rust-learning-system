<h1>Encapsulation That Hides Implementation Details</h1>
<p>Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of <em>encapsulation</em>,
which means that the implementation details of an object aren’t accessible to
code using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is
through its public API; code using the object shouldn’t be able to reach into
the object’s internals and change data or behavior directly. This enables the
programmer to change and refactor an object’s internals without needing to
change the code that uses the object.</p>
<p>We discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: We can use the <code>pub</code>
keyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in our code
should be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we
can define a struct <code>AveragedCollection</code> that has a field containing a vector
of <code>i32</code> values. The struct can also have a field that contains the average of
the values in the vector, meaning the average doesn’t have to be computed on
demand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, <code>AveragedCollection</code> will
cache the calculated average for us. Listing 18-1 has the definition of the
<code>AveragedCollection</code> struct.</p>
<p><Listing number="18-1" file-name="src/lib.rs" caption="An <code>AveragedCollection</code> struct that maintains a list of integers and the average of the items in the collection"></p>
<p>```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-01/src/lib.rs}}</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;/Listing&gt;

The struct is marked `pub` so that other code can use it, but the fields within
the struct remain private. This is important in this case because we want to
ensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the average is
also updated. We do this by implementing `add`, `remove`, and `average` methods
on the struct, as shown in Listing 18-2.

&lt;Listing number=&quot;18-2&quot; file-name=&quot;src/lib.rs&quot; caption=&quot;Implementations of the public methods `add`, `remove`, and `average` on `AveragedCollection`&quot;&gt;

```rust,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch18-oop/listing-18-02/src/lib.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>The public methods <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> are the only ways to access
or modify data in an instance of <code>AveragedCollection</code>. When an item is added to
<code>list</code> using the <code>add</code> method or removed using the <code>remove</code> method, the
implementations of each call the private <code>update_average</code> method that handles
updating the <code>average</code> field as well.</p>
<p>We leave the <code>list</code> and <code>average</code> fields private so that there is no way for
external code to add or remove items to or from the <code>list</code> field directly;
otherwise, the <code>average</code> field might become out of sync when the <code>list</code>
changes. The <code>average</code> method returns the value in the <code>average</code> field,
allowing external code to read the <code>average</code> but not modify it.</p>
<p>Because we’ve encapsulated the implementation details of the struct
<code>AveragedCollection</code>, we can easily change aspects, such as the data structure,
in the future. For instance, we could use a <code>HashSet&lt;i32&gt;</code> instead of a
<code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> for the <code>list</code> field. As long as the signatures of the <code>add</code>,
<code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> public methods stayed the same, code using
<code>AveragedCollection</code> wouldn’t need to change. If we made <code>list</code> public instead,
this wouldn’t necessarily be the case: <code>HashSet&lt;i32&gt;</code> and <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> have
different methods for adding and removing items, so the external code would
likely have to change if it were modifying <code>list</code> directly.</p>
<p>If encapsulation is a required aspect for a language to be considered object
oriented, then Rust meets that requirement. The option to use <code>pub</code> or not for
different parts of code enables encapsulation of implementation details.</p>
