<h1>Increasing Functionality with a Crate</h1>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project
we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code> crate
is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other
programs and can’t be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo’s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we
can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to
include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the
following line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that
Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with
this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:
* ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.md
* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md
-->

<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">{{#include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/Cargo.toml:8:}}
</code></pre>
<p>In the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, everything that follows a header is part of that
section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code>, you
tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of
those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the
semantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands [Semantic
Versioning][semver]<!-- ignore --> (sometimes called <em>SemVer</em>), which is a
standard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually
shorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but
below 0.9.0.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version
0.8.5, and this specification ensures that you’ll get the latest patch release
that will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or
greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples
use.</p>
<p>Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown in
Listing 2-2.</p>

<p></Listing></p>
<p>You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the
code, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating
system), and the lines may be in a different order.</p>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of
everything that dependency needs from the <em>registry</em>, which is a copy of data
from [Crates.io][cratesio]. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem
post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and
downloads any crates listed that aren’t already downloaded. In this case,
although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates
that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles
them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you
won’t get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already
downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven’t changed anything
about them in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. Cargo also knows that you haven’t changed
anything about your code, so it doesn’t recompile that either. With nothing to
do, it simply exits.</p>
<p>If you open the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, make a trivial change, and then save it and
build again, you’ll only see two lines of output:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/
touch src/main.rs
cargo build -->

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
</code></pre>
<p>These lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows it can
reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.</p>

<h4>Ensuring Reproducible Builds</h4>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures that you can rebuild the same artifact every
time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of
the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say
that next week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version
contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will
break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file the first
time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <em>guessing_game</em>
directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions
of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the
<em>Cargo.lock</em> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see
that the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file exists and will use the versions specified there
rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will
remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file.
Because the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file is important for reproducible builds, it’s often
checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4>Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</h4>
<p>When you <em>do</em> want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>,
which will ignore the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file and figure out all the latest versions
that fit your specifications in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. Cargo will then write those
versions to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look
for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the <code>rand</code> crate has
released the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.999.0, you would see the following if
you ran <code>cargo update</code>:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-02/
cargo update
assuming there is a new 0.8.x version of rand; otherwise use another update
as a guide to creating the hypothetical output shown here -->

<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo update
    Updating crates.io index
     Locking 1 package to latest Rust 1.85.0 compatible version
    Updating rand v0.8.5 -&gt; v0.8.6 (available: v0.999.0)
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo ignores the 0.999.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a
change in your <em>Cargo.lock</em> file noting that the version of the <code>rand</code> crate
you are now using is 0.8.6. To use <code>rand</code> version 0.999.0 or any version in the
0.999.<em>x</em> series, you’d have to update the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to look like this
instead (don’t actually make this change because the following examples assume
you’re using <code>rand</code> 0.8):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.999.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The next time you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will update the registry of crates
available and reevaluate your <code>rand</code> requirements according to the new version
you have specified.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to say about [Cargo][doccargo]<!-- ignore --> and [its
ecosystem][doccratesio]<!-- ignore -->, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 14, but
for now, that’s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse
libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled
from a number of packages.</p>
