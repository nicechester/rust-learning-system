<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h1>More About Cargo and Crates.io</h1>
<p>So far, we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and
test our code, but it can do a lot more. In this chapter, we’ll discuss some of
its other, more advanced features to show you how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your build through release profiles.</li>
<li>Publish libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore -->.</li>
<li>Organize large projects with workspaces.</li>
<li>Install binaries from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore -->.</li>
<li>Extend Cargo using custom commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cargo can do even more than the functionality we cover in this chapter, so for
a full explanation of all its features, see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its documentation</a>.</p>
