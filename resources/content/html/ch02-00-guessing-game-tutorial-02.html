<h1>Receiving User Input</h1>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line of the program. Now we’ll call
the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user
input:</p>
<p><code>rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:read}}</code></p>
<p>If we hadn’t imported the <code>io</code> module with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of
the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as
<code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance of
[<code>std::io::Stdin</code>][iostdin]<!-- ignore -->, which is a type that represents a
handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the [<code>read_line</code>][read_line]<!--
ignore --> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.
We’re also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what
string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take
whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string
(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an
argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so that the method can change
the string’s content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a <em>reference</em>, which gives you a way to
let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to
copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,
and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use
references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this
program. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are
immutable by default. Hence, you need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than
<code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more
thoroughly.)</p>
