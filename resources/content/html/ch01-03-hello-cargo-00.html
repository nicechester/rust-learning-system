<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Hello, Cargo!</h2>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool
to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you,
such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and
building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs
<em>dependencies</em>.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any
dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it would
only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you write more
complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project
using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this book
assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust if you
used the official installers discussed in the
[“Installation”][installation]<!-- ignore --> section. If you installed Rust
through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the
following in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as <code>command
not found</code>, look at the documentation for your method of installation to
determine how to install Cargo separately.</p>
