<h1>The RFC Process and Teams</h1>
<p>So how do you learn about these new features? Rust’s development model follows
a <em>Request For Comments (RFC) process</em>. If you’d like an improvement in Rust,
you can write up a proposal, called an RFC.</p>
<p>Anyone can write RFCs to improve Rust, and the proposals are reviewed and
discussed by the Rust team, which is comprised of many topic subteams. There’s
a full list of the teams <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance">on Rust’s website</a>, which includes teams for
each area of the project: language design, compiler implementation,
infrastructure, documentation, and more. The appropriate team reads the
proposal and the comments, writes some comments of their own, and eventually,
there’s consensus to accept or reject the feature.</p>
<p>If the feature is accepted, an issue is opened on the Rust repository, and
someone can implement it. The person who implements it very well may not be the
person who proposed the feature in the first place! When the implementation is
ready, it lands on the main branch behind a feature gate, as we discussed in
the <a href="#unstable-features">“Unstable Features”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<p>After some time, once Rust developers who use nightly releases have been able
to try out the new feature, team members will discuss the feature, how it’s
worked out on nightly, and decide if it should make it into stable Rust or not.
If the decision is to move forward, the feature gate is removed, and the
feature is now considered stable! It rides the trains into a new stable release
of Rust.</p>
