<h1>Creating a Reference Cycle</h1>
<p>Let’s look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it,
starting with the definition of the <code>List</code> enum and a <code>tail</code> method in Listing
15-25.</p>
<p><Listing number="15-25" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="A cons list definition that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> so that we can modify what a <code>Cons</code> variant is referring to"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-25/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>We’re using another variation of the <code>List</code> definition from Listing 15-5. The
second element in the <code>Cons</code> variant is now <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code>, meaning that
instead of having the ability to modify the <code>i32</code> value as we did in Listing
15-24, we want to modify the <code>List</code> value a <code>Cons</code> variant is pointing to.
We’re also adding a <code>tail</code> method to make it convenient for us to access the
second item if we have a <code>Cons</code> variant.</p>
<p>In Listing 15-26, we’re adding a <code>main</code> function that uses the definitions in
Listing 15-25. This code creates a list in <code>a</code> and a list in <code>b</code> that points to
the list in <code>a</code>. Then, it modifies the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>, creating a
reference cycle. There are <code>println!</code> statements along the way to show what the
reference counts are at various points in this process.</p>
<p><Listing number="15-26" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Creating a reference cycle of two <code>List</code> values pointing to each other"></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-26/src/main.rs:here}}
</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>We create an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance holding a <code>List</code> value in the variable <code>a</code>
with an initial list of <code>5, Nil</code>. We then create an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance holding
another <code>List</code> value in the variable <code>b</code> that contains the value <code>10</code> and
points to the list in <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>We modify <code>a</code> so that it points to <code>b</code> instead of <code>Nil</code>, creating a cycle. We
do that by using the <code>tail</code> method to get a reference to the
<code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code> in <code>a</code>, which we put in the variable <code>link</code>. Then, we use
the <code>borrow_mut</code> method on the <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code> to change the value inside
from an <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> that holds a <code>Nil</code> value to the <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> in <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>When we run this code, keeping the last <code>println!</code> commented out for the
moment, we’ll get this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-26/output.txt}}
</code></pre>
<p>The reference count of the <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instances in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is 2 after
we change the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>. At the end of <code>main</code>, Rust drops the
variable <code>b</code>, which decreases the reference count of the <code>b</code> <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code>
instance from 2 to 1. The memory that <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> has on the heap won’t be
dropped at this point because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then, Rust drops
<code>a</code>, which decreases the reference count of the <code>a</code> <code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance from 2
to 1 as well. This instance’s memory can’t be dropped either, because the other
<code>Rc&lt;List&gt;</code> instance still refers to it. The memory allocated to the list will
remain uncollected forever. To visualize this reference cycle, we’ve created
the diagram in Figure 15-4.</p>
<p><img alt="A rectangle labeled 'a' that points to a rectangle containing the integer 5. A rectangle labeled 'b' that points to a rectangle containing the integer 10. The rectangle containing 5 points to the rectangle containing 10, and the rectangle containing 10 points back to the rectangle containing 5, creating a cycle." src="img/trpl15-04.svg" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 15-4: A reference cycle of lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
pointing to each other</span></p>
<p>If you uncomment the last <code>println!</code> and run the program, Rust will try to
print this cycle with <code>a</code> pointing to <code>b</code> pointing to <code>a</code> and so forth until it
overflows the stack.</p>
<p>Compared to a real-world program, the consequences of creating a reference
cycle in this example aren’t very dire: Right after we create the reference
cycle, the program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of
memory in a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more
memory than it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of
available memory.</p>
<p>Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it’s not impossible either.
If you have <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> values that contain <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values or similar nested
combinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must
ensure that you don’t create cycles; you can’t rely on Rust to catch them.
Creating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should
use automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to
minimize.</p>
<p>Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data
structures so that some references express ownership and some references don’t.
As a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership relationships and
some non-ownership relationships, and only the ownership relationships affect
whether or not a value can be dropped. In Listing 15-25, we always want <code>Cons</code>
variants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure isn’t possible.
Let’s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes
to see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent
reference cycles.</p>
