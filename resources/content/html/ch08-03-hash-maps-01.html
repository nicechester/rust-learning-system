<h1>Creating a New Hash Map</h1>
<p>One way to create an empty hash map is to use <code>new</code> and to add elements with
<code>insert</code>. In Listing 8-20, we’re keeping track of the scores of two teams whose
names are <em>Blue</em> and <em>Yellow</em>. The Blue team starts with 10 points, and the
Yellow team starts with 50.</p>

<p>Note that we need to first <code>use</code> the <code>HashMap</code> from the collections portion of
the standard library. Of our three common collections, this one is the least
often used, so it’s not included in the features brought into scope
automatically in the prelude. Hash maps also have less support from the
standard library; there’s no built-in macro to construct them, for example.</p>
<p>Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. This <code>HashMap</code> has
keys of type <code>String</code> and values of type <code>i32</code>. Like vectors, hash maps are
homogeneous: All of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values
must have the same type.</p>
