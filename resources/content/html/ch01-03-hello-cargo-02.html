<h1>Building and Running a Cargo Project</h1>
<p>Now let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the “Hello, world!”
program with Cargo! From your <em>hello_cargo</em> directory, build your project by
entering the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <em>target/debug/hello_cargo</em> (or
<em>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</em> on Windows) rather than in your current
directory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in
a directory named <em>debug</em>. You can run the executable with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal. Running <code>cargo
build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top
level: <em>Cargo.lock</em>. This file keeps track of the exact versions of
dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo
manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with <code>cargo build</code> and ran it with
<code>./target/debug/hello_cargo</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the
code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient than having to remember to run <code>cargo
build</code> and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use <code>cargo
run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn’t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling
<code>hello_cargo</code>. Cargo figured out that the files hadn’t changed, so it didn’t
rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo
would have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this
output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks
your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster than
<code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you’re
continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As
such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code> periodically as they write their
program to make sure it compiles. Then, they run <code>cargo build</code> when they’re
ready to use the executable.</p>
<p>Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using
  <code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code,
  Cargo stores it in the <em>target/debug</em> directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no
matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no
longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
