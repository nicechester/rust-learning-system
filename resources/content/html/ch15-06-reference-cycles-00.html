<h2>Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory</h2>
<p>Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to
accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a <em>memory leak</em>).
Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust’s guarantees, meaning
memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. We can see that Rust allows memory leaks
by using <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>: It’s possible to create references where
items refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the
reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values
will never be dropped.</p>
