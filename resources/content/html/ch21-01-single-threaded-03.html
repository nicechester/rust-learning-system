<h1>Looking More Closely at an HTTP Request</h1>
<p>HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the <em>request line</em> that holds information about what the
client is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the method
being used, such as <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>, which describes how the client is making
this request. Our client used a <code>GET</code> request, which means it is asking for
information.</p>
<p>The next part of the request line is <em>/</em>, which indicates the <em>uniform resource
identifier</em> <em>(URI)</em> the client is requesting: A URI is almost, but not quite,
the same as a <em>uniform resource locator</em> <em>(URL)</em>. The difference between URIs
and URLs isn’t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec
uses the term <em>URI</em>, so we can just mentally substitute <em>URL</em> for <em>URI</em> here.</p>
<p>The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line
ends in a CRLF sequence. (<em>CRLF</em> stands for <em>carriage return</em> and <em>line feed</em>,
which are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be
written as <code>\r\n</code>, where <code>\r</code> is a carriage return and <code>\n</code> is a line feed. The
<em>CRLF sequence</em> separates the request line from the rest of the request data.
Note that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than <code>\r\n</code>.</p>
<p>Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far,
we see that <code>GET</code> is the method, <em>/</em> is the request URI, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the
version.</p>
<p>After the request line, the remaining lines starting from <code>Host:</code> onward are
headers. <code>GET</code> requests have no body.</p>
<p>Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different
address, such as <em>127.0.0.1:7878/test</em>, to see how the request data changes.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let’s send back some data!</p>
