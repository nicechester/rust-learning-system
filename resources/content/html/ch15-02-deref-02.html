<h1>Using `Box<T>` Like a Reference</h1>
<p>We can rewrite the code in Listing 15-6 to use a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of a
reference; the dereference operator used on the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing 15-7
functions in the same way as the dereference operator used on the reference in
Listing 15-6.</p>
<p><Listing number="15-7" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Using the dereference operator on a <code>Box&lt;i32&gt;</code>"></p>

</code></pre>
<p></Listing></p>
<p>The main difference between Listing 15-7 and Listing 15-6 is that here we set
<code>y</code> to be an instance of a box pointing to a copied value of <code>x</code> rather than a
reference pointing to the value of <code>x</code>. In the last assertion, we can use the
dereference operator to follow the box’s pointer in the same way that we did
when <code>y</code> was a reference. Next, we’ll explore what is special about <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
that enables us to use the dereference operator by defining our own box type.</p>
