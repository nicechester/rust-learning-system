<h1>Defining Strings</h1>
<p>We’ll first define what we mean by the term <em>string</em>. Rust has only one string
type in the core language, which is the string slice <code>str</code> that is usually seen
in its borrowed form, <code>&amp;str</code>. In Chapter 4, we talked about string slices,
which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String
literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary and are therefore
string slices.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than
coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded
string type. When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might be
referring to either the <code>String</code> or the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one
of those types. Although this section is largely about <code>String</code>, both types are
used heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both <code>String</code> and string slices
are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
